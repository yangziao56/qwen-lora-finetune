 Structure: 
"The best thing about [tomorrow] is it's full of [possibilities]." - Dr Seuss: [Optimism] fuels [anticipation] as much as [curiosity] does [discovery]. 

Explanation:
1. "The best thing about" - This phrase sets up a positive sentiment and can be replaced with a brand keyword like "refreshment" to align with Coca-Cola's image of providing a delightful experience.
2. "[tomorrow]" - This placeholder indicates a variable that could represent a specific moment or event. It can be replaced with a brand keyword such as "moments" to emphasize the ephemeral yet significant nature of experiences.
3. "is it's full of" - This phrase connects the subject with its attribute and can be kept as is since it maintains the structure without needing to introduce new words.
4. "[possibilities]" - This word represents potential and can be replaced with "happiness" to reflect the emotional value Coca-Cola aims to convey.
5. "- Dr Seuss" - This attribution remains fixed as it provides context and credibility to the quote.
6. "[Optimism] fuels [anticipation]" - Here, "optimism" can be replaced with "refreshment" to reinforce the idea of a positive outlook leading to excitement. "Anticipation" is a suitable placeholder that fits the context.
7. "as much as" - This conjunction can remain unchanged as it serves to compare two ideas effectively.
8. "[curiosity] does [discovery]" - Both "curiosity" and "discovery" are placeholders that maintain the sentence structure but can be adjusted in context. "Discovery" could be replaced with another brand keyword like "moments" to emphasize the exploration aspect of the quote.
