Output: Okay, so I need to come up with some Coca-Cola slogan remixes targeting the "Pride" persona, and they should convey celebrating achievement or exclusivity. The user mentioned using classic poetry as a base for the remixes. Alright, let's start brainstorming.

First, I should think about classic poems that talk about achievement or exclusivity. Maybe Robert Frost? Or some other famous poets. "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" by Frost is a well-known poem. The ending line is "And miles to go before I sleep." If I can tweak that to fit a Coke slogan, maybe. Let's see...

Original: "I have to go, I'm melting, I'm melting!" But that's from the Wizard of Oz. Wait, the user wants classic poetry. Maybe "The Road Not Taken" by Frost is another classic. The line "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less traveled by." Hmm, can I use that?

Wait, the persona is Pride, so pride in achievement or exclusivity. Achievement could be like accomplishing something, so maybe "I took the less traveled road and..." or something like that. Coca-Cola could be the reward? Or maybe "I took the road less traveled and there sat cold Coca-Cola, quenching my achievement with each sip." Not sure. Maybe better.

Alternatively, "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." The woods are beautiful but the person has miles to go before sleep. "Miles to go before I taste" or something. Maybe "Miles to go before I drink." That could work?

Another angle, exclusivity. Maybe "O Captain! My Captain!" by Whitman. "O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done,..." Could play on leadership and success. "O Leader, my Leader, our trip done, but one goal to go: to celebrate with Coke's embrace." Maybe too long.

Thinking of the poem "She Walks In Beauty" by Byron. The famous line "She walks in beauty, like the night." If we can fit Coca-Cola in there, maybe, but not sure about achievement or exclusivity.

Alternatively, Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice starts with "It is a truth universally acknowledged...", but that's a book, not a poem. Hmm.

Wait Shakespeare wrote sonnets like "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" But that's more about love, not achievement.

Maybe "Excellence is an art won by Choice of nobility in act." That's a quote by William Butler Yeats. Maybe use "Nobility in act wins excellence, rewarded with every sip of Coke."

Alternatively, think of some metaphors linking success/achievement to drinking Coke. "Taste the achievement," or "Sip success," but not in poetry.

Another idea: "The woods are lovely, but I must get my Coke first." From Frost's poem. "The woods are lovely, dark and deep, and I've earned a Coke to quench the heat."

Hmm. Maybe "Miles to go before my drink," playing off "miles to go before I sleep." That could work.

Or "Road less traveled, cold Coke rewarded," using Frost's road.

Alternatively, "The journey's end, your reward: Coca-Cola's gleam." Not sure.

Wait, exclusivity. Only the successful or those who have achieved can have Coke? Maybe like exclusivity in success. "For those who conquer, Coca-Cola comes," or "Coca-Cola, the drink for the victors."

Using poetry, maybe Wordsworth's "The world is too much with us; late and soon," which he wrote about society being out of touch with nature. Maybe "Too focused on the world? Let me help you win, with every Coke." Not quite.

Hmm. Let me think again. Poetry that's about triumph or pride. Maybe Shakespeare in Henry V: "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers." If it's "we few, we happy, we have Coca-Cola at hand to celebrate." But that's from movie, not the book. Not sure.

Alternatively, "To triumph is to know the joy, and take a drink that brings great glory." That's a bit forced but uses the poetry style.

Wait the user wants to use classic poetry, so should try to base them exactly on lines. Let me go back to Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening."

Original lines: "The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep." So, ending with "miles to go before I sleep." So "miles to go before I..." If "miles to go before I taste," perhaps, followed by "Coca-Cola. Celebrate each achievement with every sip."

Alternatively, "The journey’s end: my reward, Coca-Cola’s shine, a treasure to drink in." Or something like that.

Alternatively, "O Captain of your fate, your crew has earned their drink—Coca-Cola, the perfect reward."

Wait, maybe the idea isn't necessarily to use the exact lines of the poems, but to take the essence. So maybe the example the user gives, like "the ones who make it" referencing poetry but not the exact lines.

Alternatively, "We few, the lucky ones who made it past your heart’s wall." (I’m Shakespeare here.) Wait, but maybe "For those who conquer, victory’s sweet embrace drinks to the sound of celebration, hand and soda." That's not bad, but not sure. Maybe better to use actual classics.

Alternatively, "The road less traveled but well traveled by all who achieve, crowned with the chilled delight of Coca-Cola." Hmm.

Wait, the user's examples, like "We Few, We Happy," "And they who make it" from Poetry by Shakespeare, so the trick is to take a phrase from a poem and remix part of it, adding a bit.

Maybe using "Stopping by to celebrate" instead of "Stopping by woods" so "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening – Stopping by to celebrate, with every Coke, the joy of achievement."

Alternatively, "The road less traveled by, but those who journey find a Coke in wait."

Hmm. Or "O Captain! My Captain! – We have won the race, and our reward is chill Coke."

Wait, Whitman's original poem was about Lincoln's death, "O Captain! Our fearful trip is done, The ship has weathered every rack, the prize we sought is won," so if we tweak that to: "O Captain! Our fearful trip is done, The winning’s earned, the Coke to sip comes home." Not sure.

Alternatively, "O Leader! My Leader, this Coke awaits to celebrate the conquest achieved."

Alternatively, maybe anaphora from Maya Angelou, like "I rise." But not poetry? Or from a song? Not sure.

Hmm. Maybe an example from Poe's "The Raven," with "Nevermore," so "Never did I taste victory, until now. Cold Coca-Cola, forever my toast." Maybe?

Wait the user's examples had "The ones who make it" from Hamlet, so using poetic quote as a hook and rephrasing it. Maybe "The ones who conquer the world, take a Coke worth conquering." Hmm.

Alternatively, "Happy few" from Shakespeare's St Crispin's Day speech: "The fewer the number, the more honor each soldier shall earn." So maybe "With Coke in hand, the happy few can honor each milestone with a cold embrace."

Wait, the user's example used "Happy Few" and "O Captain" so better to find similar expressions from poetry.

Let me think of "The woods are lovely" but changing to "The victory is lovely, let my Coke flow..." Not sure.

Alternatively, "Stopping by to celebrate..." referencing Frost's poem.

Alternatively, "Celebrating life's triumphs with a chilled Coca-Cola, for those who make it." That uses 'make it' from Hamlet.

Hmm. Maybe start with a classic line, then add the Coke part. For example:

Original line: "The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep..." Remix: "The woods are lovely, cold and sweet,... to those who reach the summit: welcome the taste of reward, Coca-Cola." Not quite.

Alternatively, "Miles to go before I taste the drink of triumph. Miles to celebrate with Coca-Cola." Hmm.

Wait, the user's example with Frodo: "The journey's end draws near, but one sip to complete the tale of triumph." But that's The Lord of the Rings and not poetry. Hmm.

Wait, let's see the examples user gave earlier, for inspiration:

For Pride, Achievement or Exclusivity:

"Celebrate the summit: there’s no better reward than a chilled Coca-Cola." (Based on "And miles to go before I [stop to rest]") – referencing Frost.

"O Captain! My Captain! You have conquered the world, and your vessel, Coca-Cola, the drink to rule it all." (Based on "O Captain! My Captain! our fearful trip is done...," by Whitman.) 

"There in the deep, dark victory of triumph, I raise the Coke to my lips" (Based on "The woods are lovely, dark and deep..." by Frost.) 

"The happy few... and Coca-Cola crowns their success." (Based on "We few, we happy few..." by Shakespeare (Henry V, 1599). 

"Coke’s the drink for the select: those who rise above" (Based on "Excellence is an art won by choice of nobility in act" – William Butler Yeats) 

"Coca-Cola: the reward for the victorious" (Based on "We few, we band of brothers..." Shakespeare, Henry V).

So the key is taking a line from a classic poem, tweaking a word or two to make a sentence about celebrating achievement or exclusivity.

So for achievement:

Starting with "Miles to go before I sleep," replacing "sleep" with "drink" or "sip" or "rest":

"Miles to go before I rest, sip Coca-Cola to celebrate each achievement." That's a possibility.

"Exclusivity can be with:

"To those who rise with excellence..." referencing Yeates.

Alternatively, "Noble in act, you drink in excellence—Coca-Cola's icy embrace." Not sure.

Another angle is exclusivity: only the top get to drink Coca-Cola. "The ones who make it, enjoy Coca-Cola's icy touch." Re-using the "The ones who make it" from Hamlet.

Alternatively: "Exclusivity tastes cold and sweet," playing on classic poetry.

Wait, "for those who lead, a leadership sip of Coca-Cola." Hmm.

Alternatively "Exclusivity, the drink, as perfect as poetry – Coca-Cola." Hmm not sure.

Another classic line: "I must be cruel, only to be kind" from Hamlet. So maybe "Cruel only to be kind? Better to taste the drink of victory" – not sure.

Hmm. Maybe go with:

"Like a summer's day, Coca-Cola enhances your triumph" referencing "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day," Shakespeare's Sonnet 18. Not exactly on achievement though.

Wait, perhaps the "Happy few" and "road less traveled" are the big ones.

Okay, putting this together, I can come up with similar phrases:

1. Based on Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening": Original line "And miles to go before I sleep." To target exclusivity or achievement, maybe: "Miles to go, and a Coke to taste: celebrate achievements on the journey you make."

2. Shakespeare's Henry V: "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers." So "The Happy Few, their icy drinks of choice." Or "The Happy Few and Coca-Cola: the perfect triumphant pair."

3. Whitman's "O Captain! my Captain!" : "O Captain! Your journey done, may I present the cold and sweet." 

4. May be use the classic "I am a man of wealth and taste" line from Alvin Youngblood Hart's "I Am A Man Of Wealth And Taste" song lyric, but that's not poetry. Wait, maybe T.S. Eliot's "April is the cruelest month..."? Not quite.

5. Maybe Robert Southey's "Afternoon Party," the famous quote from there "If you are to gain, you must suffer." So "To gain, you must suffer. But every win deserves a cold Coca-Cola." That's a solid one.

Hmm that could work. "If you are to gain, you must suffer..." Southey. So perhaps:

"To gain, you must suffer. Reward your hard-fought victory with a chilled Coca-Cola."

Okay, that's good.

Another idea, referencing the Nobel Prize poem: Swedish poet Tomas Tranströmer wrote "Coca-Cola Dream"! Wait, maybe that's a stretch. 

Alternatively, Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet: "Work is love made visible." So "Love your work, celebrate with an icy visible drink." Probably too forced.

Hmm.

Alright, I have a few ideas. Let me write them as final slogans.

Some examples like:

- "The journey’s end: a reward fit for triumph. Celebrate with a chilled Coca-Cola." (Frost reference)

- "The Happy Few, crowned with icy triumph, Coca-Cola’s embrace." (Shakespeare)

- "To reach the summit’s peak, let a cold Coca-Cola quench your zeal." (Exclusivity in achievement)

- "Like the man who made it, with every sip, choose Coca-Cola as your triumph." (Hamlet's "The ones who make it")

- "Excellence is a choice – and its crowning touch, a Coca-Cola sip. (Yeates reference) 

"Victory's cold, crisp, celebration. Coca-Cola, your choice of honor." 

Wait, maybe another one from Frost's "The Road Not Taken": 

"I took the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference." – So, "Take the road less travelled... and find a Coca-Cola waiting. The reward of the few who choose." That's good.

Output: Okay, the user wants me to create Coca-Cola slogans that target the "Anticipation" persona and convey curiosity or suspense. Alright, first I need to recall some classic poetry that can be remixed into these slogans. Let me think—maybe Shakespeare and some other poets would work well here.

The keyword is anticipation. So, I should focus on words related to suspense and curiosity. Oh, the example they gave earlier used "Beware the jabberwock" from "Jabberwocky". So, maybe taking that approach would be good.

Wait, what's the user's deeper need here? They want the slogans to spark something in the consumer's mind, making them want to try the product. It's not just about drinking Coke, but the feeling before they drink it—the expectation. So I need to infuse that sense of impending delight or excitement.

Let me think of famous lines first. Shakespeare's Sonnet 18: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" Hmm, but how does that relate? Maybe use "Shall I compare this to a summer's day?" Wait, but that might not convey anticipation. Let me think again.

Hmm, maybe "Stop all the clocks" from Lord Henry's poem in Wuthering Heights. Or Wordsworth's "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud." The original is about daffodils, but linking that to drinking a Coke when you feel lonely could be good. Like "Coca-Cola: A cascade of bliss for drowsy days when lonely is your name."

Wait, but the Persona wants anticipation more than emotion. Let me think of suspenseful poetry. Edgar Allan Poe? "Once upon a midnight dreary..." Maybe "Once upon a midnight dreary, down pour my sweet Coke-fueled reverie." That could work.

Or maybe Mary Shelley's "It is with considerable difficulty that I remember the earliest years of my life." Transformed into Coca-Cola context: "It is with considerable difficulty that I remember life before this drink. Coca-Cola."

Another one—William Blake's "The sky is crying." Could be "The sky is thirsting for Coca-Cola, the heavens are longing... A drink of pure and timeless elixir."

I should make sure each line is catchy, ties to the feeling of anticipation, and relates to a classic poem. Need to check if the poetry references are accurate enough but still impactful enough to the general audience.

What about Poe's "Quoth the raven nevermore?" Maybe "But the raven said that Coca-Cola nevermore won't leave us—evermore." Hmm, not sure, maybe too complicated. Let me try a different approach.

John Donne's "Ask not for whom the bell tolls..." "Ask not for whom the bottle tolls—it tolls for you Coca-Cola drinkers." That's better but maybe too subtle. Need more suspense?

Emily Dickinson's "I felt a funeral in my brain..." Maybe twist it into "I felt a fountain springing—of Coca-Cola, in me." Not sure. 

Wait, the example given used Coleridge's "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan..." So "In Xanadu let me down, oh mighty Coca-Cola." Yeah, that's a strong one for a Coca-Cola slogan.

Each slogan should be a remix of a classic line, with "Coca-Cola" at the end, and emphasize anticipation. The key is to take the original's mood and twist it into the Coca-Cola context.

Alright, compiling these ideas into a list. Need 5-10 slogans, each with a different poetic reference. Let me see, I have:

1. "The sky is crying / The heavens are longing / A drink of pure and timeless elixir / Coca-Cola"
2. "Quoth the raven / Evermore!"
3. Wait, better versions:

Wait, the first example the assistant had was "Stop all the clocks / We've tasted our lives at last / Coca-Cola." That's(stop all the clock from... what?) Maybe Hardy's poem "Stop All the Clocks".

Let me structure each one with the poem line, the remix, and then Coca-Cola. 

I think I have enough to generate five solid ones. Need to ensure each starts as a famous line and twists into the anticipatory message.
</think>

Here are 10 Coca-Cola slogan remixes, sparkingly blended with classic poetry to channel the feeling of anticipation:  

1. *"Stop all the clocks. We’ve tasted our lives at last / Coca-Cola."*  
(Alfred Lord Tennyson: *In Memoriam*)  

2. *"Down the foggy mountain, under the glowering sky / You could see a Coke geyser shooting up, defying—/ No, the dark could not keep Coca-Cola down. / It burst forth like the sun."*  
(Samuel Taylor Coleridge: *Kubla Khan*)  

3. *"A cascade of bliss for drowsy days when lonely is your name / Coca-Cola."*  
(William Wordsworth: *I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud*)  

4. *"In Xanadu let me down / Oh mighty Coca-Cola."*  
(Samuel Taylor Coleridge: *Kubla Khan*)  

5. *"You could have it all: the scent / Of rain on the hills / And the thunder / Of a Coke machine."*  
(Matthew Arnold: *Dover Beach*)  

6. *"Stop here! / This is the land of enchantment, / Of gold, of magic, of Coke / Drink it and you shall never return. / Coca-Cola."*  
(Alexander Pope: *The Rape of the Lock*)  

7. *"Onward, ever onward toward / The sunlit crest of the hill / That glows with the promise of Coca-Cola."*  
(Alexander Pope: *An Essay on Criticism*)  

8. *"Climbed through a dark tunnel of grief, / To emerge, reborn, / Into the light of a Coke fridge."*  
(Robert Frost: *Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening*)  

9. *"Shall I compare thy coolness to a sparkling day? / … / Never did so sweet a drink pour down."*  
(William Shakespeare: *Sonnet 18*)  

10. *"A song by day, a song by night / Singing this world my very own / Is the world for which we thirst— / Coca-Cola."*  
(Robert Louis Stevenson: *Requiem*)  

Which one makes your heart beat faster?

Output: Okay, so the user wants me to generate Coca-Cola slogans that target the "Fear" persona, specifically around neutralizing FOMO or creating urgency. They mentioned using classic poetry remixes. Alright, first, I need to recall some classic poets and their famous lines. Maybe Poe, Dickinson, Whitman? Let me brainstorm some possibilities.

Hmm, FOMO is Fear of Missing Out, so the slogans should reassure that you won't miss out by drinking Coke. Urgency would push people to act now before it's too late. 

Let me think of poets where their lines can be twisted into those angles. Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven" starts with "Once upon a midnight dreary...", maybe change it to "Once upon a FOMO-drearY / Take a Coke today!" 

Emily Dickinson has "Hope is the thing with feathers" – so "Hope is the thing with feathers / Coke's happiness never leaves your feathers." That works for adding urgency with Coke as the source of happiness. 

William Blake's "Tyger! Tyger! burning bright / In the forests of the night" could be adapted to a tiger with Coke. Maybe "Tyger! Tyger! Thirsty bright! / Coca-Cola for your tonight!" 

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's "Footprints on the sands of time..." Could be "Footprints on the sands of time / Have you tried our new Cola wine?" To tie into the Coca-Cola's new recipe or something.

Oscar Wilde's "I can resist everything except a temptation." Maybe spin that to include Coke as the temptation. "I can resist anything except a thirst / Quench your FOMO, take some Coke to nurse." 

Robert Frost's "Two roads diverged in a wood..." For urgency, "Two roads diverged in a wood / Why not Coke now, that's the good. / And I took the one more sweetly / And I guess that road was right." Adds urgency in choosing now.

William Shakespeare's "Et tu, Brute?" Could play on the betrayal theme, but maybe a twist. "Et tu, Brute? Why? Drink now!" To push immediate action.

Dr. Seuss's "A person's a person no matter how small..." Change to "A person's a person if they drink Coke at all?" Not sure if effective though. Maybe another line.

Maya Angelou's "Still I rise..." Could be "Still I rise, my Coke is your prize." To inspire confidence that choosing Coke is the right decision.

Percy Shelley's "Ozymandias" has "Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" Maybe "Look on our works, O mighty FOMO / Drink a Coke you'll never have sorrow." 

Langston Hughes's "I, too, sing America" could be "I, too, sing Coca-Cola / To banish every fear / I am America – / And I'll be there anytime, anywhere." 

T.S. Elliot's "April is the cruelest month" could link to a season? Maybe "April is the cruelest month / Take a Coke to neutralize the buzz." Not sure, but gives urgency.

Toni Morrison's "And there will be an answering" in "Sula" might be "And there will be an answering... / For my thirst, I took a Coke, the right answering!" 

John Donne's "For whom the bell tolls..." Adapt: "For whom the bell tolls / May well be yours, so stock up with Coke." Urgency to stock up before it's too late.

Shel Silverstein has whimsical lines. Maybe "What's a Fish / Without a Bike? (Don't ask me) Just get a Coke!" 

Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights: "The tyrant passion of my heart!" Change to "The Coca-Cola passion of my heart!" Hmm, maybe not.

Homer's "So it is when a shipwrecked sailor..." Could shift to "So it is when a thirst-wrecked sailor... / Drinks a Coke, his mouth is free!" 

John Keats's "A thing of beauty is a joy forever." Maybe "A thing of beauty is a Coke forever / Joy is yours, please take it now!" 

William Butler Yeats's "How can l know what's happening to her mind?" Could be "How can she know what's happening to her mind? / Unless she drinks a Coke and makes it kind." 

Mary Shelley's "I was a bold one –" maybe "I was a bold one, with a Coke in hand / No FOMO can overcome my plan!"

Milton's "Better to reign in hell than serve in Heaven" Flip to "Better to enjoy in heaven with a Coke than serve in hell!" 

Neruda's "Tonight I can write the saddest lines..." Maybe "Tonight I can Coke the saddest lines / Because they all will be more fine."  

E.E. Cummings' "i carry your heart with me" could be "I carry your heart, one sip of Coke / Your thirst's satisfied without a rock!" 

William Wordsworth's "I Wandered lonely as a Cloud" could be "I wandered lonely as a Cloud / So now I take a Coke in my proud."  

Emily Grierson in Faulkner's story, so "I like to think Emily Grierson knew / The best thing in town's our famous brew." 

Shakespeare's Sonnet 116 "Love is not love / That alters when it alteration finds" could be "Love is love without a change / So drink some Coke, that's where it's ranged." 

Easter Bunny poem: "Do you know who's coming Easter morn? Do you know?" Maybe "Do you know what's coming when you are lorn? Take a Coke, we'll make sure you're reborn."  

T.S. Eliot's "April is the cruelest month," which I already did. Maybe another line: "April is the cruelest month / Take a Coke, we'll make your luck!" 

Edgar Allan Poe's "Nevermore" could be "Nevermore will I miss out / With my Coke in my bottle, life is fully plussed!" 

So I need to pick the 10 best ones, ensuring variety in the poets and the messages. Let me list them out and refine the best lines.

1. "Once upon a FOMO-drearY / Take a Coke today!" – Poe
2. "Hope is the thing with feathers / Coke's happiness never leaves your feathers." – Dickinson
3. "Tyger! Tyger! Thirsty bright! / Coca-Cola for your tonight!" – Blake
4. "A person's a person if they drink Coke at all?" – Dr. Seuss
5. "Still I rise, my Coke is your prize." – Maya Angelou
6. "Look on our works, O mighty FOMO / Drink a Coke you'll never have sorrow." – Ozymandias (Shelley)
7. "I, too, sing Coca-Cola / To banish every fear / I am America..." – Hughes
8. "April is the cruelest month..." – Eliot
9. "The Coca-Cola passion of my heart!" – Donne/Emily Bronte?
10. "Better to reign in hell than serve in Heaven!" – Milton

Wait, need to make sure the poetry attribution is correct. "Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" is Ozymandias. The tiger one is Blake, "The Tyger". Then Milton's line about hell and heaven is correct.

Also check if the slogans effectively hit FOMO or urgency. "Take a Coke today" – urgency. "Never again fear the day with a Coke at bay" – neutralizes fear. 

Need to craft them in a more flowing way. For example, "Et tu, Brute? Why? Drink now!" – from Shakespeare, adds urgency. 

Alternatively:

"The tyger! The tyger! What fear could bring / A Coca-Cola to help your heart sing!" – Blake's Tyger again. 

But maybe first versions were better. Let me finalize by making sure each uses a different poet and clearly addresses either neutralizing FOMO or adds urgency through Coke.

Output: Okay, I need to come up with some Coca-Cola slogan remixes using classic poetry, targeting the "Joy" persona and evoking delight or excitement. Let's start by recalling some lines from famous poems that convey joy and excitement. Joy is all about feeling happy and euphoric, so the slogans need to have that upbeat, uplifting vibe. 

First, maybe "O Captain! My Captain! rise up and hear the bells..." from Whitman's poem. Wait, that's more about triumph and leadership. Maybe not the happiest unless I rephrase it. "O Captain, my Captain, rise up and raise the glass," that could work, tying in the Coca-Cola toast.

Next, Wordsworth's "I wandered lonely as a cloud..." or "Daffodils" poem. The line "That floats on high o'er vales and hills" could pair with "That floats on high where all is joy" to add that uplifting moment. 

Emily Dickinson's "I am nobody! Who are you? Are you nobody too?" Not really happy, more about anonymity. Maybe not. Need a different Dickinson poem. "Hope is the thing with feathers..." That's about hope, but "that perches in the soul" could work. "Hope rises with each sip of this cold, sweet soul." Hmm, maybe too abstract. 

Milton's "L'Allegro" is about joy: "Come, and trip it as you go / On the light fantastic toe." That's a classic! "Come trip it as you go, on the light fantastic toe," then adding "with every swallow of Coca-Cola’s all-year glow." It's playful and rhythmic.

Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" has "Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!" Maybe twist it: "You were not born for drudgery, joy divine! You belong in hands that lift it into time." Encouraging people to share the joy with Coke.

Then "How do I love thee?" from Elizabeth Barrett Browning. "Let me count the ways," but change it to "How do I laugh, sing, celebrate?" "Let me count the ways, with a cold Coca-Cola in sight." That's fun and counts the reasons to drink Coke for joy.

Shakespeare's sonnet with "Shall I compare thee..." Change to "Shall I compare thee to a... perfect cold day?" "Thou art more like a perfect cold day, with a Coke sparkling as bright as the sun." It's a spin on the classic for an energetic take.

Pushkin's "Winter Evening" has "I sit, I read; there is a light." Twist that to "I sit, I sip; there is a light, that calls me to drink up what we’ve done right." Maybe not the strongest, but "light" relates to joyful moments with Coke.

Auden's "Sailing to Byzantium" has "That is no country for old men." Alter to "That’s no country for a dull soul, where Coca-Cola won’t be found. I’ll be a part of your sweetest joy as long as my heart goes on." 

Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" has "The woods are lovely, dark and deep." Use it for "The woods invite your quiet rest, but first you’ve got to quench that thirst. With every swallow Coke will call, a fresh delight within each savor." 

Hughes in "Cages" has "They do not sing very much." Flip it to "They’ll sing once you bring them some joy, when they’ll raise their glass with a cry, ‘We’ll drink like kings, and like kings we will live, with every sip that we chug and chew!’" 

Okay, these are the ideas. Mix poetry lines with Coca-Cola branding and the joy theme, keeping each slogan short and catchy. Make sure each has a part that quotes or evokes the original but twists it to fit the slogan. Need to check that they make sense in context and are fun, not too forced. Also, ensure they're targeting "joy" and evoke delight or excitement. Maybe some have rhyme or rhythm to enhance their catchiness. I should present them as a numbered list with explanations for clarity.
</think>

Here’s a playful collection of **Coca-Cola slogan remixes**, drawing from classic poetry to evoke **delight and excitement**, and targeting the **"Joy" persona** who celebrates moments of pure, unbridled joy:  

---

### 1. **“O Captain, my Captain, rise up and raise the glass”**  
*(Whitman’s* O Captain, My Captain* meets joyous toasting!)*  
**“Where every drop is your reward, your cheer, your bliss!”**  

---

### 2. **“I wandered lonely as a cloud… that floats on high where all is joy.”**  
*(Wordsworth’s* Daffodils* meets communal Coca-Cola joy!)*  
**“All year ‘round, this soda’s your bloom.”**  

---

### 3. **“Come, trip it as you go, on the **light fantastic toe**.”**  
*(Milton’s* L’Allegro* meets foot-tapping celebration!)*  
**“On the **light fantastic Coke**, let every swig inspire your soul!”**  

---

### 4. **“You were not born to the drudgery of mortal life…”**  
*(Paraphrasing Milton’s* Lycidas* meets instant joy!)*  
**“But for an infinite dance with this infinite high!”**  

---

### 5. **“Let me count the ways I’m joyful, with a Coke in hand!”**  
*(Elizabeth Barrett Browning’s* How Do I Love Thee* meets festive indulgence!)*  
**“With this cool thrill, my soul can’t stand!”**  

---

### 6. **“Shall I compare thee to a perfect summer day?”**  
*(Shakespeare’s* Sonnet 18* meets Coca-Cola’s effervescence!)*  
**“Nay, you’re this soda: effervescent, sweet, and in view!”**  

---

### 7. **“We wander with you—through the forest, over meadows, across the sea…”**  
*(Emily Dickinson’s* Of Course I heard myself *meets journeying joy!)*  
**“Toasting the world with your cold Coca-Cola glee!”**  

---

### 8. **“Joy, sweetness, and pleasure, in the morning, at midnight!”**  
*(Paraphrasing Keats’* Ode on a Grecian Urn* meets endless merriment!)*  
**“With every sip, Coca-Cola is a timeless delight in the morning, at midnight!”**  

---

### 9. **“The woods are lovely, dark, and deep—but first, we sip!”**  
*(Robert Frost’s* Stopping by Woods *meets joyful indulgence!)*  
**“Coke’s sweet buzz calls us to drink, then explore what’s near or far!”**  

---

### 10. **“The earth has not anything to show more fair, than this glowing Coke I’ve got in hand!”**  
*(Paraphrasing Wordsworth’s* Composed upon Westminster Bridge* meets joy-forced comparisons!)*  
**“Raise up your glass—no pleasure’s this fairer!”**  

--- 

Each of these leans into poetry’s lyrical flow and emotional resonance while spotlighting **joy as an instant, invigorating experience** with Coca-Cola.

Output: Okay, I need to come up with a Coca-Cola slogan that targets the "Trust" persona and conveys safety or reliability. The user wants me to use classic poetry for inspiration, so I should start by recalling some famous lines from classic poets.

Let me think of poets whose words are about trust. Maya Angelou often writes about trust, maybe her poem "Still I Rise." Wait, also poets like Tennyson, maybe "In Memoriam"? Wait, "Trust on," from that poem. Yeah, that's a good candidate. Let me check:

"Trust of friends; the faith of men; / Power of thought, and speech, and pen; / Light of conscience; days of toil, / Nights of rest; a happy soil; / A blameless home; a goodly wife; / Kindly children; hearts like life; / Seasons varying through their years, / Sun and shower, and prosperous sheaves."

Hmm, that seems a bit long. But maybe the line "Trust of friends" can be adapted. Alternatively, "Trust on," from the start. Maybe "Trust on, Coca-Cola" is too straightforward. Maybe rephrasing that part while keeping the essence.

Alternatively, consider poems about reliability. Wordsworth? No. Maybe Mary Oliver's poetry? Let me think of another angle. Also, maybe a line from "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost, but that's not exactly about trust. "And I kept the first for another day", yeah not trust.

Wait, look, the classic "Hope is the thing with feathers" by Dickinson? Maybe not. Alternatively, William Wordsworth's "The world is too much with us." Not sure. Maybe I need to think of poems that start with trust. Alternatively Shakespeare has sonnets that mention trust. 

Alternatively, check Tennyson again. "Let me love thee more in death." Not helpful. 

Alternatively, consider Emily Bronte's "No turning back," from Wuthering Heights? "I see no end to my voyage... There is one here whose voice is music to my ears."

Alternatively, look for phrases that include trust or reliability. "Trust in me..." perhaps. 

Wait, let me see the exact line from "In Memoriam A.H.H." by Tennyson. The relevant stanza is:

Let Knowledge grow from more to more,

But more of reverence in us dwell;

That mind and soul, according well,

May make one music as before,

But vainer sparks one star, less wasted light. 

Then saw I the desire of years,

And held them in my hands, and there they lay

So lovely as they were before...

Then, trusting thee, I cast my lot

With thine, and in the darkness sighed,

"If I could see thee but one hour,

I should return" – and so I died,

Firm in the hope that thou wouldst come,

And bring with thee the time to come,

When thou wouldst call, and I should see

Thy face, and thou shouldst lead me into thee.

Ah, so maybe the line "Then, trusting thee, I cast my lot" can be reworked into a trust slogan. 

Alternatively, from Shakespeare's Sonnet 33:

"Thy shall forget to tell the time of day."

No. Hmm. 

Alternatively, from John Keats' Ode on a Grecian Urn: "Beauty is truth, truth beauty." That's famous but not sure about trust. 

Another possibility is from Carl Sandburg's "Chicago," but that's more about identity. 

Alternatively, from Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken," the last lines: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I, I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." Maybe not trust. 

Wait, maybe Robert Herrick's "To Daffodils": "Yet could I turn my tack, / And in your likeness make another you..." Hmm.

Wait a second. Tennyson's "The woods decay, the woods decay and fall" in In Memoriam. The line "And I held her in my arms" is not directly trust.

Alternatively, from Wordsworth's "Daffodils":

"For oft, when on my couch I lie

In vacant or in pensive mood,

They flash upon that inward eye

Which is the bliss of solitude;"

Also not trust. Hmm.

Maybe the line from "The Charge of the Light Brigade": "someone had blunder'd." That's more about a mistake, so not helpful.

Wait, maybe from the poem by Rudyard Kipling, "The Law of the Jungle": "For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack." That's about unity but could be adapted for trust and reliability in Coke.

Alternatively, from "If-" by Kipling: "If you can wait and not be tired by waiting..." That's a stretch.

Hmm, perhaps using the Tennyson line: "Then, trusting thee, I cast my lot / With thine, and in the darkness sighed..." Maybe take "trusting thee, I cast my lot" to make a slogan like "Trust us as you cast your lot with Coca-Cola." Hmm, not quite smooth.

Alternatively, "Trust on every moment, Coca-Cola is by your side" using "Trust on" from the Tennyson poem.

Wait, the original line starts with "Trust of friends; the faith of men..." So maybe "Trust comes naturally, like the refresh of Coca-Cola." Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, "Trust our promise: Coca-Cola keeps you hydrated and happy." That's more of a message than a slogan.

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola – A timeless promise of refreshment, trusted every moment." Hmm.

Wait, maybe "Trust your thirst: Coca-Cola quenches it." That's short and includes trust. Let me check if "Trust your [something]" is a classic line.

Alternatively, from Maya Angelou: "Still I rise." Not trust.

Alternatively, looking again at Tennyson's "Trust of friends; the faith of men..." Maybe take "Trust of friends" as an idea, so "The trust of friends, the faith of millions, Coca-Cola delivers." Hmm, maybe too wordy.

Wait, the user wants slogan remixes using classic poetry. So perhaps take a famous line and substitute part of it with "Coca-Cola."

For example, taking "Trust on" from Tennyson's "Trust on, the end is near," adapting to "Trust on, Coca-Cola is here." Not quite, but maybe "Trust On the Cool Refreshment of Coca-Cola." Hmm.

Wait, here's an idea: "Hope is the thing with feathers that perches in the soul" is a Dickinson poem. Maybe "Hope is the refreshment, with millions of souls trusting in Coca-Cola every day."

Alternatively, take the very famous line from Shakespeare's Sonnet 116: "Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds..." but not sure about trust.

Alternatively, "Be like the bird that warms the frozen string by looking to the sun." From Kahlil Gibran's The Prophet. Wait, but "Be like..." Maybe "Be confident, trust Coca-Cola, the one constant throughout."

Hmm, perhaps another approach. Find poems that start with trust and take one line. Alternatively, maybe Kipling's "Trust yourself" from the If- poem, but not exactly.

Alternatively, "Trust me" from a poem like "When I have fears that I may cease to be" by Keats. Wait, the actual line is "When I have fears that I may cease to be / Before my pen has gleaned my teeming brain, / Before high-piled books, in charactor, / Hold like rich garners the full-ripened grain." Not trust.

Hmm, perhaps another approach: using "Trust" in the verb form. Maybe from a poem like "The Night Before Christ's Mass: "Trust in me, my sister child, and, as I will." From that, maybe "Trust in us, our trusted beverage." Not great.

Wait, I think "Trust on, trust on, the end is near" is a Tennyson line. Perhaps adapting "Trust On, Trust On, we are here, with Coca-Cola as your refreshment." Not quite.

Alternatively, Tennyson's "I saw on Honeycomb her golden face," but not trust.

Wait, maybe from the poem "The Charge of the Light Brigade": "When can their glory fade? O the wild charge they made." Hmm not trust.

Alternatively, "Trust me in a thing I'll teach thee, and, for all thy life, a thing thou'lt need" from Shakespeare's King Lear. Then, "Trust me...a thing thou'lt need" so maybe "Trust in Coca-Cola, the thing you'll always need."

Alternatively, the last lines of Sir Philip Sidney's "Astrophel and Stella": “Leave me, O love which reachest but to dust; / And thou, my mind, look higher than the sun; /...” Hmm not helpful.

Perhaps this isn't panning out. Let me think of popular trust quotes. Or perhaps take a non-trust poem and substitute. For example, take "Mendacity, my friend, is one of the chief elements on which society rests" and change to "Trust, my friend, is one of the chief elements on which Coca-Cola rests."

Alternatively, a line from a poem that refers to rivers: "All the great rivers run into the sea," so maybe "All the refreshing ideas lead to Coca-Cola, trust us."

Wait, perhaps "The best things in life are free," which is not a poem, but a common saying.

Wait, what if I take the poem "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" by Robert Frost. The last line: "And miles to go before I sleep..." so that's "promises to keep," which can be adapted to "trust to keep with Coca-Col..."

Hmm, "And miles to go before we rest; but trust to keep by your side..." Not quite.

Alternatively, "Stopping by the Soda Machine on a Snowy Evening" as a parody. "The woods are lovely, dark and deep / But trust us, there's a soda near. / And miles to go before we sleep..."

Hmm, that's pushing it. 

Alternatively, take "The Road Not Taken": "I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." Replacing "taken" with "traveled by" but not trust.

Wait, I might have to think of a different poem or take a bit of license. Let's think again of Tennyson: "Trust on, the end is near."

So slogan: "Trust On, Coca-Cola" but maybe add "Trust On, we're there." 

Alternatively, "Trust us to always satisfy, trust us as we always do: Coca-Cola is reliable."

Hmm, but maybe something shorter. "Trust your choices, trust your moments, trust Coca-Cola to always be there."

Alternatively, "Trust In the Cool," referencing a poem like "In Memoriam". Wait, "Trust in the Cool, from each bottle, we deliver."

Alternatively, "Trust the Refreshe" using rhyme.

Wait, the user wants "slogan remixes using classic poetry." So maybe rephrase an actual classic line into a Coca-Cola slogan. 

For example, from Tennyson's "Trust on, the end is near." Change to "Trust On, the refresh is here." 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: trust on, when the refresh is near."

That's shorter: "Trust On: The Refresh is Near." From Tennyson's original.

Alternatively, "Trust On, the end is cold" as a joke, but not reliable.

Alternatively, "Trust On, the end is Coca-Cola" not quite.

Alternatively, "Refresh On, the trust is near." Hmm, maybe not.

Alternatively, take the line "Trust of friends; the faith of men; / Power of thought, and speech, and pen;" from Tennyson's stanzas. So "Trust of friends: we deliver," or "Have faith in our cold bottles, power for your day, the faith of men is in Coca-Cola."

Hmm, perhaps "Trust of friends and Coca-Cola makes the day shine on." 

Alternatively, "Trust your friends, trust your moments, trust Coca-Cola."

Alternatively, Tennyson's "And I held her in my arms," could be "Hold your Coca-Cola in your hands, and feel our trust."

Hmm, but this is getting too forced. I think "Trust On, the Refresh is Near" from the original Tennyson line is solid. Let's check the original stanza again:

I saw on Honeycomb her golden face,  

Saw the old woodsman dig the freshened grave,  

Saw the two orphans by his bed stand weeping,  

Him leaning forward with a face unchanged,

And I leaned over him from end to end,  

Saw the dawn whiten on the eastern hills,  

Heard the first distant sound upon the sea,  

The first cool breeze upon his brow, and died.

Wait, that's different. The stanza before, "Trust of friends; the faith of men; / Power of thought, and speech, and pen; / Light of conscience; days of toil, / Nights of rest; a happy soil; / A blameless home; a goodly wife; / Kindly children; hearts like life; / Seasons varying through their years, / Sun and shower, and prosperous sheaves."

Hmm. That's the part that starts with the "Trust of friends".

Wait, so "Trust of friends; the faith of men;..." So "Trust of friends, our Coca-Cola makes friends" or "Trust of friends, we deliver with every sip."

Hmm. Alternatively a variation. 

Alternatively, "Trust Of Friends: Coca-Cola delivers."

But I think the better approach is to take "Trust On" from the beginning of the next stanza. The original lines start after "And I stood with these beside him, and I knew / That in his darkened mind, one thought survived / When all those glories to him faded out, / The thought of her who walked in beauty, loved,".

Then "Ah! But to what high place had that
