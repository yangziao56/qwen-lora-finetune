Okay, let's tackle this for Coca-Cola with the Joy persona. First, I need three classic quotes that fit delight or excitement. The user said to avoid including the persona name, just the mood. 

Hmm, classic quotes... Maybe from movies or songs? "I'm lovin' it" is McDonald's, so maybe not. Wait, the quotes need to be pre-existing, not the brand's own. 

Thinking of "Happiness is a warm puppy" by Charles M. Schulz? That's about joy. Or "Today is going to be a good day!" from some movie, maybe "Anchorman"? 

Another option: "Life is a party" by a band? Maybe Sublime? "Life is a party and parties aren't free" but too long. Maybe truncate it. 

Wait, need 5-10 words. Let me think again. 

Option 1: "Laughter is the best medicine." But that's more about health. 

Option 2: "The best things in life are free." But Coca-Cola isn't free, so maybe not. 

Wait, maybe from the Coca-Cola jingle "Open happiness"? But that's their own. 

Wait, need to use external quotes. Let me think of some popular quotes. 

Ah! "Joy is the best makeup." – Anonymous? Not sure. 

Another idea: "Let them eat cake!" but that's Marie Antoinette, and a bit negative. 

Wait, the user said lyric, quote, slang. "Turn up the volume" maybe from a song? 

Alternatively, "What's your flavor?" from a commercial? 

Wait, need to get three. Let's see.

First quote: "The greatest joy is freedom." By someone? Maybe not. 

Hmm. Maybe "Happiness is contagious" – that's a common saying. 

Alternatively, from "Anchorman": "I'm not an alcoholic... I'm a professional drinker!" but that's not right. 

Wait, maybe "Laughter is infectious" – that's a saying. 

Alternatively, "You're never fully dressed without a smile." – I think that's Diane von Fürstenberg. 

Wait, but how to match the brand. Coca-Cola's tagline is about happiness and sharing moments. 

So maybe quotes about happiness, joy, togetherness. 

Option 1: "Laughter is the best medicine." (Author: Anonymous?) – connects to feeling good. 

Option 2: "The best things in life are free, but you have to buy the guitar." (Cheech & Chong?) – but maybe too niche. 

Wait, another one: "Happiness is a warm puppy" by Charles M. Schulz. That's a classic. 

Option 3: "The greatest happiness is to be joyfully absorbed in something." (Schopenhauer?) 

Hmm, maybe. But needs to be concise. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, "What's love got to do with it?" but that's more about love. 

Wait, maybe "Today is the first day of the rest of your life." – motivational but not sure. 

Alternatively, "Seize the day!" (Carpe diem) – from Horace. 

Hmm. Let's try to list three. 

1. "Laughter is the best medicine." (Author: Anonymous) – fits joy. Explains why: links joy to healing and fun, aligning with Coca-Cola's uplifting vibe. 

2. "The greatest joy is freedom." (Perhaps not a famous author, but maybe MLK? Not sure.) 

Wait, maybe better to use a well-known one. "The best things in life are free." (Author: Haddaway's song "What is Love")? But that's about love. 

Alternatively, "Happiness is a warm puppy" (Charles M. Schulz) – connects to the warmth and comfort of Coca-Cola. 

3. "Happiness is the best makeup." (Author: unknown, maybe from a beauty brand?) 

Hmm, maybe I need better options. Let me think of another approach. 

Wait, the user's example earlier used "What's your flavor?" which is a common phrase. Maybe slang or lyric. 

Another option: "You only live once." (YOLO) – popular slang, expresses excitement and living in the moment. 

Okay, so three quotes:

1. "Laughter is the best medicine." (Anonymous) – links joy to health and feeling good.

2. "Happiness is a warm puppy." (Charles M. Schulz) – ties joy to comfort and warmth, which Coca-Cola can evoke.

3. "You only live once!" (slang) – encourages seizing the moment, aligning with Coca-Cola's celebration theme.

Now, explain each why. The best one might be "You only live once" because it's more modern and exciting, fitting the joy and excitement. 

Wait, but maybe "Happiness is a warm puppy" is more about the feeling. Let me note that. 

Alternatively, the best could be "You only live once!" as a motivational phrase. 

Okay, I'll proceed with these three.
