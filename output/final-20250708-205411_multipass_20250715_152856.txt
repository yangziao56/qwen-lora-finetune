Okay, I need to come up with three classic quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand and the joy persona. The user wants something that evokes delight or excitement. Let's think of popular expressions that have a happy, uplifting vibe.

First, maybe "Happy Days Are Here Again" – that's a song and also associated with Franklin D. Roosevelt's campaign. It's cheerful and about joy, which matches Coca-Cola's celebratory image. 

Next, "Life is a party, and I want to party" from the song "I Want Candy." The phrase "Life is a party" is catchy and conveys constant celebration, which Coca-Cola could tie into their drink being part of every happy moment.

Then, "What's love got to do with it?" by Tina Turner, but maybe not as directly related to joy. Wait, maybe another one. How about "The best things in life are free, but you can't give them away" – but that's more about value. Hmm. Maybe "Enjoy everyday" from a different source? Not sure. Alternatively, "Turn up the volume on life" – not a classic quote. Wait, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return" by Beatles? Not exactly. Maybe "Don't worry, be happy" by Bobby McFerrin. That's a good one for joy. 

Wait, the user wants classic quotes, so "Don't worry, be happy" by Bobby McFerrin is a song lyric from 1988. That's a solid choice. So the three quotes would be:

1. "Happy Days Are Here Again" – FDR and song. Matches because it's all about joyful times, perfect for Coca-Cola's association with happy moments.
2. "Life is a party, and I want to party" – "I Want Candy" song. Conveys constant celebration and fun.
3. "Don't worry, be happy" – Bobby McFerrin. Encourages positivity, aligning with the joy persona.

Now, explaining why each matches. The first one is a classic and directly about happy days. The second is about life as a continuous party. The third is a motivational phrase promoting happiness. The best might be the first, as it's more traditional and Coca-Cola often uses "happiness" themes. So mark that with a star.

Next, structure breakdown. Take the first quote: "Happy days are here again." Break it into parts. Maybe "Happy days are | here again." The fixed parts are "are here again," and "happy days" could be replaced with brand keywords. Alternatively, "Happy days are | here again." The editable parts could be "happy" and "here" or "days." Wait, the user says to separate with | where editable and fixed. The brand needs to be inserted, so maybe replace "happy days" with "Coca-Cola moments" or something. But the user allows changing at most two words. Let's see.

Vocabulary replacement: For "Happy days are here again," replacing "days" with "moments" and "here" with "everywhere" might work. Or "Coca-Cola moments are here to stay" but that might not fit. Alternatively, "Happy moments are here to share" with "Coca-Cola." Wait, the structure breakdown needs to show which parts can be changed. The best is to keep the structure. So "Happy [brand-related] are [action/phrase]." 

Possible replacements: "Coca-Cola moments are here to celebrate!" But need to keep within two words. Let me think. Maybe "Happy moments are here again with Coca-Cola." But that adds more words. Alternatively, "Happy moments are here to share." Hmm.

Alternatively, in the remix step, maybe "Coca-Cola moments are here to celebrate!" but need to fit the original structure. Let me see the original quote structure again. The original is "Happy days are here again." So replacing "days" with "moments" and "here" with "everywhere" gives "Happy moments are everywhere again," but maybe better to end with "here to stay" or "here to share." Alternatively, "Coca-Cola moments are here to share." Wait, perhaps the best is to keep "are here" and replace "days" with "moments" and add "Coca-Cola" somewhere. Maybe "Coca-Cola moments are here to share!" but the original structure is "Happy [noun] are here [phrase]." So maybe "Coca-Cola moments are here to enjoy!" or "Happy moments are here with Coca-Cola."

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: Happy moments are here again." That keeps the structure except adding the brand name. The original quote is "Happy days are here again." So replacing "days" with "moments" and adding "Coca-Cola" at the beginning. The replacement would be changing "days" to "moments" and inserting the brand name. Since adding the brand name counts as a change, but the limit is two words. Let me count: Original words are 5: "Happy days are here again." If we replace "days" with "moments" (1 change) and add "Coca-Cola" at the start (another change?), but inserting the brand name might be considered adding instead of replacing. The user says "changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit." So adding "Coca-Cola" before the quote would count as one word addition. 

Hmm, perhaps the best is: "Coca-Cola moments are here to celebrate!" But that's more than two changes. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola moments are here again." That replaces "days" with "moments" and adds "Coca-Cola" as the first word. But that's two changes (adding the brand name counts as one, replacing "days" as the other). That would work. 

So the remix slogan would be "Coca-Cola moments are here again." But maybe better to end with a stronger verb. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: Happy moments are here to stay!" but that changes "again" to "stay." Not sure. Alternatively, "Happy moments are here with Coca-Cola." But that structure might be okay. 

Wait, in step 3, replacements should be 1-2 sets. For the first quote, replacing "days" with "moments" and "here" with "everywhere" to make "Happy moments are everywhere again." But adding the brand name would need another change. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola moments are here to shine!" but that's stretching. Maybe better to go with "Coca-Cola moments are here again." That keeps the original structure except replacing "days" and adding the brand name. Since the user allows adding the brand name as a change, that's within two changes. 

Alternatively, another set could be "Happy moments are here to share with Coca-Cola." But that's more words. Hmm. 

Alternatively, using "Don't worry, be happy" as the quote might allow easier brand insertion. But the user said the first quote is best. Let me check again. 

Original step 1 quotes:

1. "Happy days are here again" ★
2. "Life is a party, and I want to party" (Erasure, from "I Want Candy"?)
3. "Don’t worry, be happy" 

Wait, actually, "Life is a party, and I want to party" is from "I Want Candy" by the band? The original song is by Warwick, but the 80s version by Bow Wow Wow. Maybe better to attribute correctly. Alternatively, maybe "Life is a party" as a shortened version. 

But moving forward, the best match is the first quote. So proceeding with that. 

Now, the structure breakdown would be:

Structure: "Happy | days are | here again." The editable parts are "Happy" (maybe not, since it's key to the emotion), "days", "here". So replacing "days" with a brand-related term like "moments", and "here" with "everywhere" or "here" to "now" etc. 

Replacement options: 

Option 1: Replace "days" with "moments" and "here" with "everywhere", making "Happy moments are everywhere again." Then add "Coca-Cola" as "Coca-Cola moments..." but that would need replacing "happy" with "Coca-Cola moments", which is more changes. Alternatively, insert the brand before: "Coca-Cola moments are here again." That replaces "days" with "moments" and adds the brand name (counts as two changes). 

Option 2: Replace "days" with "times" and "here" with "now", but not sure. 

Alternatively, "Happy moments are here to share with Coca-Cola." But that's more changes. 

The best is to do "Coca-Cola moments are here again." which replaces "days" with "moments" and adds the brand name (two changes). 

So the remix slogan would be "Coca-Cola moments are here again!" or "Coca-Cola moments are here again." with a period. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola: Happy moments are here to stay!" but that changes "again" to "stay". 

Alternatively, the original quote is "Happy days are here again." So inserting Coca-Cola as "Coca-Cola: Happy moments are here again!" That keeps the structure, replaces "days" with "moments", and adds the brand name. So two changes (replacing one word and adding the brand). 

Yes, that works. 

So putting it all together.
