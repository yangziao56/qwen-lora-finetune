--- Pass 1 (valid) ---
Okay, let's tackle this slogan remix for Coca-Cola. The persona is Joy, aiming to evoke delight or excitement. I need to start with Step 1: Quote Matching.

First, I need three quotes that fit the joyful, exciting vibe. Let's brainstorm some classic lines. 

Hmm, "Happy Days Are Here Again" is a well-known song from the 1930s by Milton Ager and Jack Yellen. It's upbeat and celebratory, which matches Coca-Cola's association with happiness. 

Another thought: "Life is a party, and you're invited!" I'm not sure the author here. Maybe a common saying? It's about joy and inclusion, which Coca-Cola often promotes with sharing moments. 

Wait, maybe "What's happiness without a smile?" No, that's too generic. Let me think again. 

Oh, "The best things in life are free, but you can't beat a good Coke!" Wait, that's more of a Coca-Cola ad jingle. The original might be from their 1971 ad. The line "The Pause That Refreshes" is older, but maybe not as catchy for today. 

Wait, another option: "Make every day a celebration!" Maybe from a greeting card? Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Turn up the volume on your happiness." Hmm, not quite. 

Wait, the song "You Make My Dreams" by Hall & Oates has the line "You make my dreams come true," but that's more romantic. 

Wait, "I want to hold your hand" by The Beatles is joyful but not exactly. 

Maybe "Life is better with a little Coca-Cola," but that's too direct. 

Wait, the original quotes need to be existing ones. Let me think again. 

Another idea: "Life's a Beach" from the band The Hooters? "Life is a beach and I'm ready to ride!" That's fun and carefree. 

Or "Let's go all the way!" from a song? 

Wait, "I'm a Survivor" by Destiny's Child? "I'm a survivor" – maybe not. 

Hmm. Let me go back. 

First quote: "Happy Days Are Here Again" by Ager/Yellen. Definitely fits. 

Second quote: "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong. The lyrics include "I see trees of green, red roses too..." which is about appreciating life's joys. 

Third quote: Maybe "Life is a party, and you're invited!" Though I'm not sure the origin. Maybe from a Hallmark card or a movie. 

Wait, "Life is a cabaret, old chum" from Cabaret. Not joyful exactly. 

Alternatively, "Just do it" is Nike, but not relevant. 

Alternatively, "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King, meaning "no worries." That's a positive, carefree vibe. The authors would be the songwriters. 

Wait, "Hakuna Matata" is from the 1994 movie, written by Tim Rice and Elton John. That could work. It's about living joyfully without stress. 

Hmm. Let me pick three. 

Option 1: "Happy Days Are Here Again" – author Ager/Yellen. Why: Celebrates joy and positive times, aligns with Coca-Cola's happy moments. 

Option 2: "Hakuna Matata" – "No worries for the rest of your days" – Tim Rice & Elton John. Matches carefree joy. 

Option 3: "Life is a party, and you're invited!" – maybe unknown author. Encourages joining in the fun, which Coca-Cola invites people to. 

Wait, but I need to check if those quotes are correct. 

Alternatively, "The best things in life are free, but you can't beat a good Coke" was the 1971 ad slogan. Maybe using that? But the user wants to remix a quote, not the brand's own. 

Alternatively, "Share a Coke and a smile" is their current campaign, but again, their own. 

So sticking with other sources. 

So three quotes: 

1. "Happy Days Are Here Again" ★ (best match because it's a classic, upbeat, and directly ties to happy times, which Coke is all about). 

2. "Hakuna Matata – no worries for the rest of your days!" (from The Lion King song) – conveys carefree joy. 

3. "Life is a party, and you're invited!" (unknown author) – emphasizes inclusion and celebration. 

Now, for each, explain why they fit: 

1. "Happy Days Are Here Again" fits because it's an anthem of optimism and celebration, perfect for Coca-Cola's association with joyful moments. ★ 

2. Hakuna Matata's carefree message aligns with Coca-Cola's role in creating happy, stress-free moments. 

3. The party invitation vibe encourages sharing joy, which is central to Coca-Cola's brand. 

Okay, that should be Step 1 done. Now the user's next step will be Structure Breakdown, but I need to make sure I follow all steps correctly.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. **"Happy Days Are Here Again"** ★ (Milton Ager & Jack Yellen) – Celebrates unbridled optimism and joy, mirroring Coca-Cola’s role in creating happy moments.  
2. **"Hakuna Matata – no worries for the rest of your days!"** (Tim Rice & Elton John) – Encourages carefree living, aligning with Coca-Cola’s association with effortless delight.  
3. **"Life is a party, and you're invited!"** (Anonymous) – Invites inclusivity and celebration, reflecting Coca-Cola’s communal joy.  

Structure:  
**"Happy | Days | Are Here | Again"**  
Editable parts: "Days" and "Again" can be replaced to incorporate brand keywords. "Days" ties to moments, while "Again" emphasizes recurrence, which works well with Coca-Cola’s ongoing presence in joyful events.  

Replacements:  
1. **"Moments | of Joy | Are Here | to Share"** – "Moments" and "Share" emphasize Coca-Cola’s role in creating and spreading joy.  
2. **"Delights | Are Here | to Savor"** – "Delights" and "Savor" highlight the sensory pleasure of the drink, but loses some rhythm.  

Remix Slogan: "Happy Moments of Joy Are Here to Share!"

--- Pass 2 (valid) ---
Okay, let's tackle this Coca-Cola slogan remix. The persona is Joy, so I need something that evokes delight or excitement. Let's start with Step 1: Quote Matching.

First, I need three quotes that fit the mood. Let me brainstorm some popular expressions. The classic "Just Do It" is too sports-focused. Maybe "Make every moment a party"? Wait, that's more of a slogan already. Hmm.

Thinking of songs or quotes associated with happiness. "What's love got to do with it?" Not exactly joy. Wait, "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey? The chorus is catchy. "Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world." No, not the best. Maybe the line "Don't stop believin', hold on to that feelin'"? That's about hope and joy.

Another option: "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King. The phrase is about no worries, which ties into joy. The lyrics say "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" That's cheerful.

Or maybe "Life is a party" from a song? "Life is a party, and you're invited!" Not sure the origin. Alternatively, the song "Happy" by Pharrell Williams has "Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof!" That's energetic.

Wait, the user wants quotes, slang, lyrics, or popular expressions. Let's pick three:

1. "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way." — Gloria Estefan. This directly relates to enjoying life, which Coca-Cola associates with.

2. "Hakuna Matata! Means no worries for the rest of your days." — Timon & Pumbaa (The Lion King). The phrase is about carefree living, which aligns with Coca-Cola's happy moments.

3. "What's up with that smile? You must be happy." — Not sure the exact source, but maybe a common saying. Alternatively, "The best things in life are free" but that's more about value.

Wait, Gloria Estefan's quote is perfect. Let's check why each matches.

First quote: Gloria Estefan's lyric about living life joyfully, matching Coca-Cola's celebratory vibe. 

Second: Hakuna Matata is about no worries, which ties into enjoying moments with Coke.

Third option: Maybe "Just a breath away from happiness" from somewhere? Not sure. Alternatively, "The joy of Pepsi" but that's a competitor's slogan. Hmm.

Alternatively, "Just do it" is Nike, not relevant. 

Wait, another lyric: "Turn it up, turn it loose, let the music take you somewhere." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Happy Days Are Here Again" – the song from the 1930s, associated with optimism. That's a good one. The original quote is from the song, so that's valid. 

Let me list three:

1. "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way." — Gloria Estefan. Matches because Coca-Cola is linked to celebrating moments as joyful parties.

2. "Happy days are here again!" — Traditional (from the song by Jimmy Kennedy). Conveys excitement and joyous times, perfect for Coca-Cola's goal.

3. "Hakuna Matata! Means no worries for the rest of your days." — Timon & Pumbaa (The Lion King). Encourages carefree living, aligning with Coca-Cola's joy in everyday moments.

Now, which is the best match? Gloria Estefan's is very party-centric, which Coca-Cola uses. "Happy Days Are Here Again" is more of a historical reference but might be too old. Hakuna Matata is more about no worries, which is also good but maybe less directly tied to celebration. The best might be Gloria Estefan's quote, so mark that with ★.

Step 1 done. Now Step 2: Structure Breakdown.

Take the Gloria Estefan quote: "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way."

But need to separate fixed and editable parts. The user wants to replace words with brand keywords. Let's see the structure:

"Life is a [fixed: party], and I want to live it that way."

But the original quote has "party", which is a good keyword. The brand is Coca-Cola, so maybe replace "party" with a Coca-Cola related term? Or replace "live it that way" with something involving the brand?

Alternatively, the brand name can be inserted. Wait, in Step 3, we can replace up to two words. The brand name counts as a replacement. Let me think.

Breaking down the quote into fixed and editable parts with |:

"Life is a | party | , and | I | want to live it that way."

But the user says to separate with |, so maybe structure as:

"Life is a | [party] | , and | [I want] | to live it that way."

Hmm, maybe better to split where the brand can be inserted. Alternatively, the structure breakdown step is to show which parts are fixed and which can be edited. The goal is to replace words with brand keywords.

Wait, the structure breakdown step says: "Copy the ★ quote and use | to separate editable and fixed parts. Point out which words can be replaced with brand keywords and why."

So, Gloria Estefan's quote: "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way."

Break into parts where the replaceable words are. The "party" is a key noun here. The verb "want" might also be replaced, but the subject "I" is first person, which the final slogan must avoid. However, in Step 2, the breakdown is before considering the constraints. The constraints about avoiding first-person are for the final remix, but in Step 2, maybe it's okay.

So the editable parts might be "party" and "I want". The "party" can be replaced with Coca-Cola-related terms like "Coke moment" or "soda". The "I want" could be changed to a more neutral phrase, but maybe the focus is on replacing key nouns.

Alternatively, "Life is a [blank], and [blank] is the way to live it." But need to structure with |.

Let me structure it as:

"Life is a | party | , and | I want | to live it that way."

Here, "party" and "I want" are the editable parts. Because "party" is central to the quote's meaning, replacing it with a Coca-Cola term (like "Coke moment") would tie the brand in. "I want" could be changed to a more universal phrase like "we crave" or "everyone wants", but need to avoid first-person. Alternatively, maybe "enjoy" instead of "want".

But the user says to point out which words can be replaced with brand keywords. The "party" is a prime candidate. Replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" would make sense. Or "soda" but that's too generic. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola" can be inserted somehow.

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coke party..." but that's stretching. The goal is to keep the structure but substitute words. Let's see.

In Step 3, the replacement suggestions would be to swap "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" or "Coke moment". Also, changing "I want" to something like "let's live" to remove first-person. But in Step 2, the breakdown is just identifying editable parts.

So for structure breakdown:

Structure: "Life is a | party | , and | I want | to live it that way."

Editable parts are "party" and "I want". The "party" can be replaced with brand-related terms because it's the central metaphor of celebration. The "I want" can be adjusted to a more inclusive or brand-centric phrase.

Moving to Step 3: Vocabulary Replacement.

Replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" (or "Coke moment") to tie the brand into the celebration. Alternatively, "soda" but that's too generic. Alternatively, "joy" but that's the persona's name. Wait, the persona's goal is to evoke joy, so maybe "joy" is the keyword. But the brand is Coca-Cola, so better to include their name.

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and [something]..." But need to keep the structure. Let's think of two sets:

Set 1: Replace "party" with "Coke moment" and "I want" with "we all want". That would make: "Life is a Coke moment, and we all want to live it that way." But "we all want" uses first-person plural (we), which is against the constraint. Wait, the constraint says to avoid first-person (I, we, me, etc.). So "we" is not allowed.

Alternative for the second part: "everyone wants" – still okay? Or "there's no better way" to remove first-person.

Hmm, maybe replace "I want" with "enjoy" or "choose". Let's try:

Set 1: Replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" and "I want" with "enjoy". So the quote becomes "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and enjoy to live it that way." That doesn't flow well. Maybe structure issues.

Alternatively, replacing just "party" with "Coca-Cola" would make: "Life is a Coca-Cola, and I want to live it that way." That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola party". So: "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and I want to live it that way." But the first-person remains. Alternatively, changing "I want" to "everyone wants".

Set 1:
- "party" → "Coca-Cola moment" (so Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and...)
- "I want" → "everyone wants" (but "everyone" is okay, not first-person)

So the slogan: "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and everyone wants to live it that way." 

Set 2: Replace "party" with "joy" (from the persona's joy theme) and "I want" with "let’s live" (neutral). "Life is a joy, and let’s live it that way." But "joy" is the persona's goal, and "let's live" is better. But then where does Coca-Cola come in? Maybe that's not the best.

Alternatively, keep "party" as "Coca-Cola party" and "I want" → "there's no better way". So: "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and there's no better way to live it that way." Hmm, not great.

Alternatively, replace "party" with "Coca-Cola" and adjust the second part: "Life is a Coca-Cola, and you can live it that way." No, not right.

Hmm, maybe another approach. The original quote is "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way." To make it about Coca-Cola, perhaps:

"Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and you can live it that way." But need to ensure it's in third person.

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and everyone’s living it that way." That works better. 

Wait, the user allows replacing at most two words. Let me count:

Original quote: Life is a party, and I want to live it that way.

Option 1: Replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" (1 word), and "I want" with "everyone wants" (2 words). But that's two words, so allowed. 

So the sentence becomes: "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and everyone wants to live it that way." But "Coca-Cola moment" is two words replacing one, so maybe that's over? Wait, the instruction says "changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Original quote has "party" as one word. Replacing it with "Coca-Cola moment" is adding two words but replacing one. That might be over the limit. Let me check the exact wording:

"Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Ah, so each replacement counts as a change. So replacing "party" (1 word) with "Coca-Cola moment" (2 words) would count as changing 1 word to 2, which is an addition, so that counts as one replacement? Or each word in the replacement is a change? 

Wait, maybe the user means that the total number of words changed (i.e., replaced) is at most two. So replacing "party" with "Coke" is one word change. Or replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola" is two words for one, so that counts as one word replaced (since "party" is one word, and replacing with two words would count as a single replacement but adding words, which might be okay as long as total replaced words are within two.

Alternatively, to stay under two, maybe just replace "party" with "Coca-Cola" (one word for one), and then change "I want" to "you can" (two words for two words). Let's try:

"Life is a Coca-Cola, and you can live it that way." But "Coca-Cola" as a singular noun here doesn't fit. "Life is a Coca-Cola" sounds odd.

Alternatively, replace "party" with "Coke party", so two words replacing one. That would count as one replacement (since "party" is replaced with "Coke party"), so total changes: one. Then change "I want" to "everyone wants" (another change). So total two changes, which is allowed.

So slogan: "Life is a Coke party, and everyone wants to live it that way." 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and you can live it that way." 

But the rhythm might be off. Let's see:

Original: "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way."

Coca-Cola version: "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and you can live it that way."

That adds two words (Coca-Cola and party), replacing the original "party" with "Coca-Cola party", so that's a one-word replacement (original "party" becomes "Coca-Cola party", which is adding two words but replacing one word, so it counts as a single change? Not sure. Maybe safer to do "Coke party" as two words for "party", so replacing one with two, but counting as one change.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" (two words) and keep the second part as "you can" instead of "I want". So two changes: replacing "party" (1 word → 2 words) and "I want" (2 words → "you can" (2 words)), so total two changes. That works.

So the replacements would be:

Set 1: "party" → "Coca-Cola moment" and "I want" → "you can"

Resulting in: "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and you can live it that way."

But "Coca-Cola moment" is three syllables (Coke-a-Cola mo-ment?), which might keep the rhythm. The original was "par-ty" (two syllables). "Coca-Cola" is four syllables, but maybe it flows.

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke moment..." which is shorter.

Alternatively, the best set would be replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola" and "I want" with "you can" (so two changes). "Life is a Coca-Cola, and you can live it that way." Hmm, but "a Coca-Cola" is awkward.

Hmm, perhaps the best option is to go with "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and you can live it that way." Even if it's a bit long, as long as the rhythm is kept.

Alternatively, the other set: replace "party" with "Coke moment" (two words replacing one, so one change), and "I want" with "there's no better way" (so replacing two words with four, which is over the limit). Probably better to stick to two changes.

Alright, moving to Step 4: Remix Generation.

Using the best replacement, which would be replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" and "I want" with "you can".

Final slogan: "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and you can live it that way."

Check constraints: No first-person. "You can" is okay. Brand name included. Syntax and meter preserved? Let's see:

Original: "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way."

Original syllables: 5 (Life is a par-ty) | 7 (and I want to live it that way)

Coca-Cola version: "Life is a Coke-la Cola mo-ment, and you can live it that way." Hmm, syllables might be longer. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola moment" is 5 syllables (Co-ca-Cola mo-ment). The second part: "and you can live it that way" is 7 syllables. Original second part was 7 syllables. So the meter is similar.

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and you can live it that way." That should work. 

Alternatively, another version from Set 2, but I think this is the best.

--- Pass 3 (valid) ---
Okay, so I need to create a slogan for Coca-Cola with the tone of Joy, aiming to evoke delight or excitement. Let's start with Step 1: Quote Matching.

First, I need three quotes, slang, lyrics, or popular expressions that fit the joy theme. The user mentioned not to include the persona name, just reflect the mood through wording. Also, each needs an author and a reason why they match. The best one gets a ★.

Hmm, classic joyful expressions... Maybe something like "Life is a party" by Gloria Estefan? That's upbeat and party-oriented, which aligns with Coca-Cola's festive image. Another could be "Just do it" but that's more about action, not sure. Wait, maybe a song lyric like "Living on a prayer" by Bon Jovi? Not exactly joy, more about hope. 

Wait, "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King. That's about no worries, which is joyful and carefree. That's good. The song says "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase" so maybe that's the quote. 

Another thought: "Happy Days Are Here Again" the song, used in political campaigns too. That's a classic happy phrase. 

So compiling three:

1. "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong. His song is all about appreciating life's simple joys, which matches the Coca-Cola vibe. 

2. "Hakuna Matata (No Worries)" from The Lion King. The song emphasizes living joyfully without stress, perfect for Coca-Cola as a refreshment that brings happiness.

3. "Life is a Party" from Gloria Estefan's song. It's about living life joyously, which Coca-Cola often pairs with parties and celebrations.

Now, which is the best? "Hakuna Matata" is catchy and the song is about joy and letting go, which Coca-Cola can associate with moments of relaxation and happiness. Maybe that's the ★. Alternatively, "What a Wonderful World" is more about the world's beauty, but less directly about celebration. "Life is a Party" is more active, which could be better. Hmm. The user wants to evoke excitement or delight. "Life is a Party" is a good match because it's energetic and Coca-Cola is linked to parties. So maybe "Life is a Party" gets the star. Or "Hakuna Matata" is more specific to joy. 

Alternatively, "Hakuna Matata" is a phrase from a Disney movie, which is family-friendly and universal. It's also a phrase that's been used in other contexts. Maybe that's better. 

Wait, the user's example for Coca-Cola might have used "Hakuna Matata" before? Not sure. Let me think again. The quote needs to be something that can be easily adapted. "Life is a party" can be rephrased to "Life is a celebration with Coca-Cola" but maybe that's stretching. 

Alternatively, "Hakuna Matata" is a fun phrase, but maybe the author is the songwriters, like from the movie. The Lion King's songwriters are Tim Rice and Elton John, but the lyric is part of the movie's characters. Maybe attribute to "The Lion King" as the source.

Alternatively, "Just say Yes" from someplace? Not sure. 

Okay, moving forward. 

Step 1:

1. "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" from The Lion King. This phrase encapsulates carefree joy and celebration, aligning with Coca-Cola's role in happy moments. ★

2. "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong. Celebrates life's joys, resonating with Coca-Cola's presence in delightful experiences. 

3. "Life is a Party" from Gloria Estefan. Emphasizes perpetual celebration, fitting Coca-Cola's festive brand image.

Wait, the first quote's explanation needs to be one sentence. Let me adjust.

So:

1. "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" (The Lion King soundtrack). This phrase captures carefree joy, ideal for Coca-Cola's celebratory moments. ★

2. "What a Wonderful World" (Louis Armstrong). Celebrates life's simple joys, aligning with Coca-Cola's uplifting presence. 

3. "Life is a Party" (Gloria Estefan). Embodies perpetual celebration, fitting Coca-Cola's festive image. 

That works. The first one is the best because it's a phrase that's catchy and can be adapted. 

Now moving to Step 2: Structure Breakdown. Take the ★ quote, which is "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" 

We need to separate the quote into editable and fixed parts with |. So: 

"Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!" 

Wait, but the structure should show where words can be replaced. Maybe the fixed part is "what a wonderful phrase!" and the first part is the editable part. So the original is "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" 

Breaking it down:

Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!

So the first part is the editable part, which can be replaced with a brand keyword. The fixed part remains. 

The words that can be replaced are "Hakuna Matata" with a brand-related term. Alternatively, maybe "wonderful" can be replaced? But the brand name needs to be included. The user says to include brand name/keyword. 

Wait, the goal is to replace words with brand keywords. Since the brand is Coca-Cola, maybe replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" or a keyword like "Coke", but also need to keep the structure. 

Alternatively, the structure allows replacing "Hakuna Matata" with a phrase that includes the brand. For example, "Coca-Cola" plus something else? But the user says to change at most two words. 

Alternatively, maybe "Hakuna Matata" is the phrase to replace with the brand. Let's see. The fixed part is "what a wonderful phrase!", so the editable part is "Hakuna Matata". 

Possible replacements for "Hakuna Matata" could be "Coca-Cola", but "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful phrase!" doesn't make sense. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe the structure can be adjusted. Alternatively, perhaps the "wonderful" can be replaced with a brand-related adjective. But the brand name needs to be in there. 

Alternatively, maybe the phrase can be structured so that "Hakuna Matata" becomes a Coca-Cola reference. 

Alternatively, maybe the fixed part is "what a wonderful phrase!", and the editable part is the first part. 

So the replacement would be replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" but that might not fit. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola brings..." but that would require changing more than two words. 

Hmm, maybe the quote structure allows replacing "Hakuna Matata" with a phrase like "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful..." but that's stretching. Alternatively, the "phrase" part could be replaced? 

Alternatively, maybe the fixed part is "what a wonderful [adjective]". So replacing "phrase" with "drink"? Not sure. 

Wait, the user's instruction for step 2 says to point out which words can be replaced with brand keywords. So in "Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!", the "Hakuna Matata" can be replaced with the brand name, but that's a noun. Alternatively, "wonderful" could be replaced with an adjective from the brand's keywords. 

Wait, the brand is Coca-Cola, which is known as the "Real Thing", "Taste the Feeling", etc. Maybe "wonderful" can be "delicious" or "sparkling", but that's a stretch. Alternatively, maybe "phrase" can be replaced with "soda" or "drink". 

Alternatively, the structure might need a different approach. Maybe "Hakuna Matata" is the main part to replace, but it's a foreign phrase. 

Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Let's see the example. The user's example for Step 2 might be something like "I'm Lovin' It | McDonald's" but that's not. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure is:

Original: "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!"

Break into: "Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!"

So the editable part is "Hakuna Matata", which can be replaced with "Coca-Cola" or a phrase that includes it. But "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful phrase!" doesn't make sense. Maybe "Coca-Cola, what a refreshing phrase!" but that changes two words. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure is more flexible. Let me see. Maybe the fixed part is "what a wonderful phrase" and the first part is the editable. So replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola's" or "Coca-Cola". 

Wait, perhaps "Coca-Cola's Joy, what a wonderful feeling!" But that would require changing more than two words. 

Alternatively, if we can only change two words, perhaps "Coca-Cola, what a refreshing phrase!" but "refreshing" is a Coca-Cola attribute. 

Hmm, maybe the problem is the original quote is "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" which is two parts separated by a comma. The structure breakdown is to separate the parts that can be changed. 

Alternatively, the "Hakuna Matata" is the main noun phrase, so replacing that with "Coca-Cola" would make it "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful phrase!" but that's awkward. 

Alternatively, maybe the fixed part is "what a wonderful phrase" and the editable part is the first phrase. So the replacement can be "Coca-Cola's moment, what a wonderful phrase!" but that's adding words. 

Hmm, maybe the best approach is to use "Coca-Cola" as a replacement for "Hakuna Matata", but the sentence structure doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola brings what a wonderful..." but that's not good. 

Alternatively, perhaps the structure can be rephrased to fit better. Let me think again. 

Wait, maybe the best way is to replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and then adjust the structure. For example: "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful drink!" But that's changing "phrase" to "drink", so two words. That's allowed. 

So in the structure breakdown, the words that can be replaced are "Hakuna Matata" (replace with Coca-Cola) and "phrase" (replace with "drink" or "moment"). 

Alternatively, "wonderful" could be replaced with "sparkling" (a Coca-Cola attribute) but that's one word. 

So, the key is to keep the syntax and meter. The original has "Hakuna Matata" (a two-word phrase), so replacing with a two-word brand-related phrase. Maybe "Coca-Cola" is one word, so that's okay. 

Hmm, perhaps the structure is acceptable as is, with the main editable part being the first phrase. 

Moving on to Step 3: Vocabulary Replacement. Need to propose 1-2 replacements. 

Option 1: Replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "phrase" with "moment": "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful moment!" 

Reason: "moment" aligns with joyful moments associated with Coca-Cola. 

Option 2: Replace "phrase" with "delight" to make "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful delight!" but that doesn't include the brand name. 

Hmm, the brand name must be included. So Option 1 is better. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola's joy, what a wonderful phrase!" but that's changing two words. 

Alternatively, replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola's taste" and keep "phrase" but that might not fit. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful feeling!" using "feeling" as in their slogan "Taste the Feeling". 

That's better. "Feeling" instead of "phrase" and "Coca-Cola" instead of "Hakuna Matata". So two words changed. 

So:

Replacement 1: "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful feeling!" (replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "phrase" with "feeling"). 

Reason: "feeling" ties to Coca-Cola's "Taste the Feeling" and conveys the emotional experience. 

Replacement 2: "Coca-Cola, what a refreshing phrase!" but "refreshing" is a brand attribute. 

But "phrase" still feels out of place. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful moment!" 

So maybe the first option is better. 

Step 4: Remix Slogan would be "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful feeling!" which fits the structure. 

Wait, but the original structure was "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" so replacing both words would maintain the structure. 

Yes, that's within the two-word change limit. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" but that doesn't add the brand's essence. 

Hmm, "feeling" is better. 

So the final slogan would be "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful feeling!" 

Wait, but the original quote's punctuation had an exclamation, so we should keep that. 

Yes, so the Remix Slogan: "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful feeling!"

Checking constraints: no first-person words, brand is mentioned. 

Yes, that works. 

Wait, but the structure breakdown step needs to explain which parts are replaceable. Let me recap:

Structure: Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!

Replaceable parts are "Hakuna Matata" and "phrase". 

So the explanation is: The "Hakuna Matata" segment can be replaced with a brand term, and "phrase" can be swapped to highlight Coca-Cola's experience.

Therefore, the final slogan would fit. 

I think that's the process.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. **"Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!"** (The Lion King soundtrack). This phrase captures carefree joy, ideal for Coca-Cola's celebratory moments. ★  
2. **"What a Wonderful World"** (Louis Armstrong). Celebrates life's simple joys, aligning with Coca-Cola's uplifting presence.  
3. **"Life is a Party"** (Gloria Estefan). Embodies perpetual celebration, fitting Coca-Cola's festive image.  

Structure:  
**Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!**  
Replaceable parts: "Hakuna Matata" (brand keyword/noun) and "phrase" (adjective/noun to emphasize Coca-Cola's experience).  

Replacements:  
1. **Coca-Cola | what a wonderful feeling!**  
   *Reason:* "Feeling" ties to Coca-Cola’s "Taste the Feeling" slogan while retaining joy.  

Remix Slogan:  
**"Coca-Cola, what a wonderful feeling!"**

Okay, so the user wants me to create a slogan for Coca-Cola with the tone of joy and excitement. Let me start with Step 1: Quote Matching. I need three quotes that fit the joy and Coca-Cola vibe.

First, I think of classic Coca-Cola slogans. They often use phrases like "Open Happiness" or "Taste the Feeling," but maybe a lyric or quote would be better here. The quote needs to be something that can be remixed. 

Hmm, "What's happening, Coca-Cola?" comes to mind, but that's more of a tagline. Maybe a song lyric. "Come on, feel the noise" from Quiet Riot? Wait, that's more about loud parties. Or "Living on a Prayer" by Bon Jovi? Not exactly. 

Wait, the user said to list three sentences with authors. Let me think of quotes related to joy and happiness. "Happiness is a warm gun" by The Beatles? No, that's more metaphorical. Maybe "Life is a party" from a song? 

Ah, "Life is a party and I want to party every day" from Selena? That's a good fit because it's all about joy and celebration, which aligns with Coca-Cola's festive image. 

Another option: "Just do it!" from Nike, but that's more about action. Maybe "Let's dance!" by Donna Summer? "Let's dance, let's dance, let's dance!" That's energetic and joyful. 

Third, maybe "The best things in life are free, but you can't give them to me" from Queen's Another One Bites the Dust? Not exactly. Wait, "Don't Stop Me Now" by Queen? The lyrics say "I'm a rocket man" but that's not the quote. 

Alternatively, "It's the most wonderful time of the year" from the song "It's the Most Wonderful Time of the Year" by Andy Williams. That's festive and joyful, perfect for Coca-Cola's holiday campaigns. 

Wait, the user wants three quotes. Let me list:

1. "Life is a party and I want to party every day" by Selena. This matches because it's about constant celebration and joy, aligning with Coca-Cola as a drink for any happy occasion.
2. "Let's dance!" by Donna Summer. It's energetic and invites joining in fun, which Coca-Cola could associate with.
3. "It's the most wonderful time of the year" from the song by Andy Williams. This is festive and joyful, linking to Coca-Cola's holiday imagery.

I think the first one is best because it's more about ongoing joy and partying, which Coca-Cola can symbolize all year. The third is more seasonal. The second is good but maybe less connected. So mark the first as ★.

Moving to Step 2: Structure Breakdown. Take the ★ quote: "Life is a party and I want to party every day". 

Break it into editable parts. The fixed parts might be "Life is a ___ and I want to ___ every day". The editable parts are the two blanks. The first blank (party) can be replaced with something like "soda", and the second action (party) with a verb related to drinking Coke. But wait, the structure needs to separate fixed and editable parts. Maybe "Life is a [party] and I want to [party] every day". The author is Selena. 

The brand keywords for Coca-Cola could replace "party" with "Coke" or "Coca-Cola", but also the verb part. Maybe "Life is a Coke and I want to sip every day". Hmm, not sure. The replacements need to fit the rhythm. 

In Step 3: Vocabulary Replacement. Maybe replace "party" (first instance) with "Coca-Cola" and the second "party" with "celebrate". So "Life is a Coca-Cola and I want to celebrate every day". But that might not flow well. Alternatively, "Life is a Coke and I want to drink every day". But "drink" is common, maybe "savor". 

Alternatively, changing the second verb to "enjoy" with "Coca-Cola" in the first blank. "Life is a Coca-Cola and I want to enjoy every day." That's better. But does it keep the rhythm? Original had "party" and "party", which are both two syllables. "Coca-Cola" is three syllables. Maybe shorten to "Coke": "Life is a Coke and I want to celebrate every day." That works better. 

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a soda and I want to sip every day" but that's not brand-specific. The key is to include the brand name. 

Step 4 Remix: Using the best replacement. Let's go with "Life is a Coke and I want to celebrate every day!" But wait, the original quote uses "party" twice. Maybe "Life is a Coke and I want to toast every day!" Hmm, "toast" is a verb but might not fit. 

Alternatively, "Life is a celebration and I want to Coca-Cola every day" but that's awkward. 

Wait, perhaps keeping the structure: "Life is a Coca-Cola and I want to sip it every day!" But that changes the verb to "sip it", which might not be as catchy. 

Alternatively, "Life is a party and I want to Coca-Cola every day" but that doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the structure. 

Alternatively, changing the first blank to "Coke" and the second verb to "celebrate": "Life is a Coke and I want to celebrate every day!" That's better. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke and I want to pop every day!" (pop meaning open a can). Not sure. 

Wait, maybe the first replacement should be "Coca-Cola" in the first blank, and the second verb as "celebrate": "Life is a Coca-Cola and I want to celebrate every day!" That works. 

Alternatively, using "Life is a party and I want to Coca-Cola every day" but that's not grammatically correct. 

Hmm, maybe the best is "Life is a Coke and I want to celebrate every day!" That keeps the structure, includes the brand, and maintains the joy. 

But the user said to limit to changing two words. Original quote has two "party" instances. So changing the first "party" to "Coke" and the second "party" to "celebrate" would be two changes. That's allowed. 

So the final slogan would be "Life is a Coke and I want to celebrate every day!" 

Wait, but the user also said not to use first-person pronouns. The original quote has "I want to", which uses "I". The constraints say not to use first-person. So that's a problem. 

Oh right! The final slogan must not use I, we, me, etc. So need to adjust that part. 

Hmm, how to rephrase without first-person. Maybe "Life is a Coke, celebrate every day!" But that changes structure. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke and you want to celebrate every day!" Still has "you want", which is second person. Wait, the constraints allow second or third person. The instruction says "Speak from a neutral or second-/third-person perspective so the brand is mentioned, not the narrator."

So "you want" is okay. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke, celebrate every day!" That's shorter, removes the pronoun. Maybe better. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke, so celebrate every day!" 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke—celebrate every day!" 

Hmm. Need to keep the original syntax as much as possible. The original quote had "and I want to party every day". To avoid first-person, maybe replace "I want to" with "you can" or "join". 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke and join every day's celebration!" Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke and celebrate every day!" Removing the verb "want" entirely. 

This is tricky because the original quote uses "I want to". To make it second person, "Life is a Coke and you want to celebrate every day!" but that's okay as per constraints. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke and there's a reason to celebrate every day!" 

Hmm. Maybe the best is to adjust the structure slightly. Let me try again. 

Original structure breakdown: "Life is a | party | and I want to | party | every day."

Editable parts are "party" (first), "party" (second), and "I want to". Since we can change two words, maybe replace both "party" instances. 

First "party" becomes "Coke" and second "party" becomes "celebrate". So: "Life is a Coke and I want to celebrate every day." But the "I want to" is first person. To fix that, change "I want to" to "you can" or "there's a reason to". 

Alternatively, rephrase the second part: "Life is a Coke, celebrate every day!" 

This drops the verb and uses an imperative, which is second person. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke, so celebrate every day!" 

That works. It keeps the structure without first-person pronouns. 

So the final slogan would be "Life is a Coke, celebrate every day!" with a period or exclamation. 

Wait, the user's example used a period but maybe an exclamation is better for excitement. 

So putting it all together, the steps would be:

Step 1:
1. "Life is a party and I want to party every day" by Selena ★ (matches joy and perpetual celebration)
2. "Let's dance!" by Donna Summer (energetic invitation, aligns with joy)
3. "It's the most wonderful time of the year" by Andy Williams (festive joy, seasonal)

Step 2: Structure: Life is a | party | and I want to | party | every day. | 
Editable parts: first "party", second "party", and "I want to". But we can change two words. 

Step 3: Replacements: 
- Replace first "party" with "Coke" and second "party" with "celebrate" (brand name and action verb to evoke celebration)
- Or "Coca-Cola" and "enjoy"

Step 4: Remix Slogan: "Life is a Coke, celebrate every day!" (keeps structure minus first-person, includes brand, maintains rhythm)

Wait, but the original structure has "and I want to", so omitting that part. Alternatively, restructure to avoid first-person. 

Hmm, maybe another approach. Let me check the exact instructions again. The final slogan must not use first-person. So "Life is a party and I want to party every day" has "I want to", so that's out. 

Therefore, to fix that, need to rephrase. 

Alternative approach: Take the quote and rephrase the verb part. 

Original quote: "Life is a party and I want to party every day."

To make it neutral: "Life is a party and there's a reason to party every day." 

Then replacing "party" with "Coke" and "party" with "celebrate": 

"Life is a Coke and there's a reason to celebrate every day."

But that's a bit long. Maybe "Life is a Coke, celebrate every day!" as before. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke, so celebrate every day!" 

Yes, that's better. It keeps the imperative, avoids first-person. 

So the final slogan would be "Life is a Coke, celebrate every day!" 

I think that works. Let me check all constraints:

- Neutral perspective? Yes, it's an imperative statement, no first-person.
- Includes brand name (Coke)
- Keeps original meter: "Life is a party and I want to party every day" has a certain rhythm, but the remix is shorter. Maybe it's acceptable since we're allowed to change two words. 

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coke and celebrate every day!" which is a bit closer in structure. 

But "Life is a Coke, celebrate every day!" is concise and ends with exclamation. 

Alright, that's the plan.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "Life is a party and I want to party every day" by Selena ★ (matches perpetual celebration and joy).  
2. "Let’s dance!" by Donna Summer (energetic invitation to joy).  
3. "It’s the most wonderful time of the year" by Andy Williams (festive, joyful tone).  

Structure:  
Life is a | party | and I want to | party | every day.  

Replacements:  
- Replace first **"party"** → **"Coke"** (brand name as the central symbol of joy) and second **"party"** → **"celebrate"** (action verb aligning with Coca-Cola’s festive spirit).  
- Alternative: Replace first **"party"** → **"Coca-Cola"** and second **"party"** → **"enjoy"** (more literal association with drinking).  

Remix Slogan:  
"Life is a Coke, celebrate every day!"

Okay, I need to come up with three quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand and the joy persona. The user wants something that evokes delight or excitement. Let me think of some famous quotes, lyrics, or phrases that are upbeat and joyful.

First, maybe "What's happening, Coca-Cola?" – but wait, that's their actual slogan. Maybe not. Let me think of other sources. "Make every moment a celebration" – that's a bit generic but positive. Hmm. 

Wait, the user wants to remix a classic quote, not make up one. So I should look for existing lines. Oh, "Happiness is the best makeup" by Marilyn Monroe. That's perfect because it's about happiness, which ties into Coca-Cola's theme of joy. 

Another one could be from "The Joy of Life" by Henri Matisse, but that's more art. Maybe a song lyric? "You make my dreams come true" is from a song, but not exactly a quote. 

Oh, "The best things in life are free, but you can't beat a cold drink on a hot day." Wait, that's not a classic. Maybe "Life is better with Coca-Cola" but again, that's their own slogan.

Alternatively, "Just do it" – no, that's Nike. 

Hmm, maybe "I'm a believer" from the Monkees? Not exactly. 

Wait, the Beatles song "Here comes the sun" – but that's more about positivity. 

Wait, "When the going gets tough, the tough get going" – not really joyful. 

Let me think of famous quotes about happiness. Maya Angelou had one: "Happiness is the best makeup." That's the same as before. 

Another option: "Happiness is like a butterfly; the more you chase it, the more it eludes you." But that's not positive enough. 

Oh, from the movie "Forrest Gump": "Life is like a box of chocolates..." but that's not exactly about joy. 

Wait, the lyric from "Don't Worry, Be Happy" by Bobby McFerrin. That's a good one. The whole song is about joy and not worrying. The chorus is "In every life we have some trouble, but when you worry, baby, you make it double. Don't worry, be happy." 

That's a good match for Coca-Cola's joy. So maybe the line "Don't worry, be happy" could be a source. 

Another one: "Joy is the best perfume," but I'm not sure who said that. 

Wait, maybe the song "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong? The lyrics "I see trees of green, red roses too..." but hard to pick a specific line. 

Alternatively, "Life is a party" by Selena Gomez? 

Wait, "Life's a party and you're invited" – that's a real slogan, maybe for another brand. 

Alternatively, "The best things in life are free, but you can't beat a cold drink on a hot day." Hmm, that's a bit clunky but the idea is there. 

Wait, maybe "Make every moment count" – but again, not a classic quote. 

Let me go back. The three quotes I can think of are:

1. "Happiness is the best makeup" by Marilyn Monroe. This works because it's directly about happiness, which is key for Coca-Cola's joy. 

2. "Don't worry, be happy" from Bobby McFerrin's song. Encourages joy and positivity, which aligns with the brand's goal. 

3. "What's so great about it?" from the Coca-Cola ad from the 90s, but that's their own slogan again. 

Alternatively, maybe the line from "The Joy of Life" by Henri Matisse? No, that's an art piece. 

Wait, maybe the lyric from "Life is a Highway" by Tom Cochrane: "Life is a highway..." but not exactly about joy. 

Hmm, maybe the quote from Anne Frank: "The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the sky and trees, and birds." But that's too long and maybe not the best fit. 

Alternatively, "Joy is the simplest form of gratitude" – not sure the author. 

Wait, maybe "Happiness is contagious" – but not sure who said that. 

Alternatively, the song lyric "Living on a Prayer" by Bon Jovi, but that's more about determination. 

Alternatively, "You've got to accentuate the positive" from the song "Accentuate the Positive". 

Hmm. Let me settle on the three best options:

1. "Happiness is the best makeup" by Marilyn Monroe – because it's a strong statement about happiness. 

2. "Don't worry, be happy" by Bobby McFerrin – catchy and directly about joy. 

3. "The best things in life are free, but you can't beat a cold drink on a hot day." Wait, maybe that's a real quote? I think it's from a Coca-Cola ad. Let me check. Oh, actually, "The Pause That Refreshes" was an old slogan. Alternatively, maybe the line "Open Happiness" which is their current tagline. 

Alternatively, the line from "The Joy of Life" is a painting, so not a quote. 

Another thought: "Laughter is the best medicine" – not exactly, but connects to joy. 

Alternatively, "Live for today, because tomorrow might be a rainy day." Not a real quote. 

Alright, I think the best three quotes are:

1. "Happiness is the best makeup" by Marilyn Monroe. 

2. "Don't worry, be happy" from Bobby McFerrin's song. 

3. "Life is a party and you're invited" – maybe from an ad? 

Wait, I need to ensure they are actual quotes, lyrics, or popular expressions. 

Alternatively, the lyric from "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong: "I see trees of green, red roses too..." but the main line is "I think to myself, what a wonderful world." 

So maybe "What a wonderful world" could be a source. 

So, three options:

1. "Happiness is the best makeup" – Marilyn Monroe (★ best match)

2. "Don't worry, be happy" – Bobby McFerrin

3. "What a wonderful world" – Louis Armstrong 

Now, explaining why each matches:

1. Directly ties happiness (joy) to the brand's goal of evoking delight. 

2. Encourages a positive, carefree attitude which aligns with Coca-Cola's celebratory vibe. 

3. Celebrates the positivity of life, which can be linked to enjoying a Coke. 

The best match is Marilyn Monroe's quote because it's a direct statement about happiness, a core theme. 

Moving on to structure breakdown. Let's take the first quote: "Happiness is the best makeup." 

Breaking into parts to replace: "Happiness is the best makeup." The fixed parts might be "is the best," and the editable parts are "Happiness" and "makeup." 

Wait, the user wants to replace words with brand keywords. The brand is Coca-Cola, so maybe "Happiness is the best Coca-Cola." But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best happiness." Hmm. 

Alternatively, the structure breakdown: "Happiness | is the best | makeup." The first and last words can be replaced. 

Possible replacements: "Coca-Cola is the best [something]." Maybe "Coca-Cola is the best refreshment." 

Alternatively, "Joy is the best Coca-Cola" but that's mixing. 

Alternatively, the original quote is "Happiness is the best makeup." To make it a slogan for Coca-Cola, replacing "Happiness" with the brand's keyword like "Coca-Cola" and "makeup" with something related, like "refreshment." 

So "Coca-Cola is the best refreshment." But that's a bit too direct. Alternatively, keeping the structure: "Coca-Cola is the best [brand keyword]." Maybe "Coca-Cola is the best buzz." Not sure. 

Wait, the brand goal is to evoke delight or excitement. Maybe "Coca-Cola is the best celebration." Hmm. 

Alternatively, "Delight is the best Coca-Cola." No. 

Hmm, maybe changing both words: "Coca-Cola is the best joy." But that's not great. 

Alternatively, keeping "Happiness is the best Coca-Cola." But that's not natural. 

Wait, maybe the structure breakdown needs to allow for replacing "Happiness" with "Coca-Cola" and "makeup" with a synonym for joy or happiness. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola is the best mood." 

Wait, the original quote is "Happiness is the best makeup." If we take the structure: 

[Happiness] is the best [makeup]. 

Replace "Happiness" with "Coca-Cola" and "makeup" with "refreshment." 

"Coca-Cola is the best refreshment." But that's not as catchy. 

Alternatively, "Joy is the best Coca-Cola." Not quite. 

Hmm, maybe the key is to keep the structure but make it about Coca-Cola. 

Alternatively, replacing "makeup" with "celebration." 

Wait, maybe "Happiness is the best Coca-Cola." No, that's not right. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: the best happiness." But that's not a sentence. 

Wait, the structure breakdown should show which parts can be replaced. The original quote is "Happiness is the best makeup." 

Breaking into parts: 

[Happiness] is the best [makeup]. 

The fixed parts are "is the best." 

So the two editable parts are "Happiness" and "makeup." 

Possible replacements for "Happiness": maybe "Coca-Cola" (brand name), or a synonym like "Joy." 

For "makeup": perhaps "refreshment," "celebration," "moment," "time." 

So a slogan could be "Coca-Cola is the best refreshment." 

Or "Coca-Cola is the best celebration." 

Alternatively, "Joy is the best Coca-Cola." Hmm. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best buzz." (but "buzz" is slang for energy, not sure). 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best mood." 

Hmm, maybe "Coca-Cola is the best moment." 

Wait, "the best moment" is better. 

Wait, but the quote is about happiness being the best makeup. So replacing "Happiness" with "Coca-Cola" and "makeup" with "moment" or "joy." 

"Coca-Cola is the best joy." 

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best [something]." 

Alternatively, maybe the best replacement is "Coca-Cola is the best celebration." 

That seems better. So the replacement set would be: "Happiness" → "Coca-Cola" and "makeup" → "celebration." 

Alternatively, replacing only one word? The user allows up to two. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best way to enjoy." Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe the original quote can be slightly altered to include the brand. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure breakdown is different. 

Wait, maybe the fixed part is "is the best," and the editable parts are the first and last nouns. 

Alternatively, perhaps "Happiness is the best makeup" can become "Coca-Cola is the best buzz." 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, considering the lyric "Don't worry, be happy," maybe that's better. Let me think again. 

If the user's best quote is Marilyn Monroe's, then proceed with that. 

Alternatively, maybe the best replacement is "Happiness is the best Coca-Cola buzz." 

Wait, but that might not fit the rhythm. 

Alternatively, "Happiness is the best Coca-Cola moment." 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best happiness." 

Wait, maybe "Happiness is the best Coca-Cola." No, that's not right. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: the best happiness." 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, changing both: "Coca-Cola is the best buzz." 

Buzz could imply energy, but maybe not the best fit. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best mood." 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best refreshment." That's a bit literal but okay. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best celebration." 

Celebration is a good keyword since Coca-Cola is often associated with celebrations. 

So, in the structure breakdown, the original quote is "Happiness | is the best | makeup." 

The editable parts are "Happiness" and "makeup." 

Replacing them with "Coca-Cola" and "celebration." 

So the slogan becomes "Coca-Cola is the best celebration." 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best buzz." 

But maybe "Coca-Cola is the best celebration." sounds better. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best way to celebrate." 

Wait, but that changes more than two words. The original quote is "Happiness is the best makeup," so replacing two words: "Happiness" with "Coca-Cola" and "makeup" with "celebration." 

So the slogan would be "Coca-Cola is the best celebration." 

That's concise and fits the rhythm. 

Alternatively, another set: replacing "Happiness" with "Joy" and "makeup" with "Coca-Cola." 

"Joy is the best Coca-Cola." Doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best joy." 

Hmm, but "joy" is the persona's tone. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best happiness." 

That's okay but not as strong. 

Hmm. Maybe "Coca-Cola is the best buzz" is too informal. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best refreshment." 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best mood." 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe using "the best" is okay. 

Alternatively, maybe the best replacement is "Coca-Cola is the best refreshment." 

But I think "Coca-Cola is the best celebration" is better because celebration ties into the joy and delight aspect. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the best buzz" could imply energy, but maybe not the right connotation. 

Hmm. I'll go with "Coca-Cola is the best celebration." as the slogan. 

Wait, but in the structure breakdown, the original quote was "Happiness is the best makeup." So replacing "Happiness" with "Coca-Cola" and "makeup" with "celebration." 

That gives "Coca-Cola is the best celebration." 

Alternatively, if we can only change two words, that's within the limit. 

Alternatively, maybe replacing "makeup" with "refreshment" gives "Coca-Cola is the best refreshment." 

But that's more literal. 

Hmm. The user wants to evoke delight or excitement, so "celebration" might be better. 

Alright, I think I can proceed with that.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. **"Happiness is the best makeup."** - Marilyn Monroe ★  
   Matches because it directly ties "happiness" to Coca-Cola's joy-driven mission, emphasizing positivity.  
2. **"Don’t worry, be happy."** - Bobby McFerrin

-----------------------------------------------
Okay, let's tackle this Coca-Cola slogan remix. The persona is Joy, so I need something that evokes delight or excitement. Let's start with Step 1: Quote Matching.

First, I need three quotes that fit the mood. Let me brainstorm some popular expressions. The classic "Just Do It" is too sports-focused. Maybe "Make every moment a party"? Wait, that's more of a slogan already. Hmm.

Thinking of songs or quotes associated with happiness. "What's love got to do with it?" Not exactly joy. Wait, "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey? The chorus is catchy. "Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world." No, not the best. Maybe the line "Don't stop believin', hold on to that feelin'"? That's about hope and joy.

Another option: "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King. The phrase is about no worries, which ties into joy. The lyrics say "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" That's cheerful.

Or maybe "Life is a party" from a song? "Life is a party, and you're invited!" Not sure the origin. Alternatively, the song "Happy" by Pharrell Williams has "Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof!" That's energetic.

Wait, the user wants quotes, slang, lyrics, or popular expressions. Let's pick three:

1. "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way." — Gloria Estefan. This directly relates to enjoying life, which Coca-Cola associates with.

2. "Hakuna Matata! Means no worries for the rest of your days." — Timon & Pumbaa (The Lion King). The phrase is about carefree living, which aligns with Coca-Cola's happy moments.

3. "What's up with that smile? You must be happy." — Not sure the exact source, but maybe a common saying. Alternatively, "The best things in life are free" but that's more about value.

Wait, Gloria Estefan's quote is perfect. Let's check why each matches.

First quote: Gloria Estefan's lyric about living life joyfully, matching Coca-Cola's celebratory vibe. 

Second: Hakuna Matata is about no worries, which ties into enjoying moments with Coke.

Third option: Maybe "Just a breath away from happiness" from somewhere? Not sure. Alternatively, "The joy of Pepsi" but that's a competitor's slogan. Hmm.

Alternatively, "Just do it" is Nike, not relevant. 

Wait, another lyric: "Turn it up, turn it loose, let the music take you somewhere." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Happy Days Are Here Again" – the song from the 1930s, associated with optimism. That's a good one. The original quote is from the song, so that's valid. 

Let me list three:

1. "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way." — Gloria Estefan. Matches because Coca-Cola is linked to celebrating moments as joyful parties.

2. "Happy days are here again!" — Traditional (from the song by Jimmy Kennedy). Conveys excitement and joyous times, perfect for Coca-Cola's goal.

3. "Hakuna Matata! Means no worries for the rest of your days." — Timon & Pumbaa (The Lion King). Encourages carefree living, aligning with Coca-Cola's joy in everyday moments.

Now, which is the best match? Gloria Estefan's is very party-centric, which Coca-Cola uses. "Happy Days Are Here Again" is more of a historical reference but might be too old. Hakuna Matata is more about no worries, which is also good but maybe less directly tied to celebration. The best might be Gloria Estefan's quote, so mark that with ★.

Step 1 done. Now Step 2: Structure Breakdown.

Take the Gloria Estefan quote: "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way."

But need to separate fixed and editable parts. The user wants to replace words with brand keywords. Let's see the structure:

"Life is a [fixed: party], and I want to live it that way."

But the original quote has "party", which is a good keyword. The brand is Coca-Cola, so maybe replace "party" with a Coca-Cola related term? Or replace "live it that way" with something involving the brand?

Alternatively, the brand name can be inserted. Wait, in Step 3, we can replace up to two words. The brand name counts as a replacement. Let me think.

Breaking down the quote into fixed and editable parts with |:

"Life is a | party | , and | I | want to live it that way."

But the user says to separate with |, so maybe structure as:

"Life is a | [party] | , and | [I want] | to live it that way."

Hmm, maybe better to split where the brand can be inserted. Alternatively, the structure breakdown step is to show which parts are fixed and which can be edited. The goal is to replace words with brand keywords.

Wait, the structure breakdown step says: "Copy the ★ quote and use | to separate editable and fixed parts. Point out which words can be replaced with brand keywords and why."

So, Gloria Estefan's quote: "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way."

Break into parts where the replaceable words are. The "party" is a key noun here. The verb "want" might also be replaced, but the subject "I" is first person, which the final slogan must avoid. However, in Step 2, the breakdown is before considering the constraints. The constraints about avoiding first-person are for the final remix, but in Step 2, maybe it's okay.

So the editable parts might be "party" and "I want". The "party" can be replaced with Coca-Cola-related terms like "Coke moment" or "soda". The "I want" could be changed to a more neutral phrase, but maybe the focus is on replacing key nouns.

Alternatively, "Life is a [blank], and [blank] is the way to live it." But need to structure with |.

Let me structure it as:

"Life is a | party | , and | I want | to live it that way."

Here, "party" and "I want" are the editable parts. Because "party" is central to the quote's meaning, replacing it with a Coca-Cola term (like "Coke moment") would tie the brand in. "I want" could be changed to a more universal phrase like "we crave" or "everyone wants", but need to avoid first-person. Alternatively, maybe "enjoy" instead of "want".

But the user says to point out which words can be replaced with brand keywords. The "party" is a prime candidate. Replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" would make sense. Or "soda" but that's too generic. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola" can be inserted somehow.

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coke party..." but that's stretching. The goal is to keep the structure but substitute words. Let's see.

In Step 3, the replacement suggestions would be to swap "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" or "Coke moment". Also, changing "I want" to something like "let's live" to remove first-person. But in Step 2, the breakdown is just identifying editable parts.

So for structure breakdown:

Structure: "Life is a | party | , and | I want | to live it that way."

Editable parts are "party" and "I want". The "party" can be replaced with brand-related terms because it's the central metaphor of celebration. The "I want" can be adjusted to a more inclusive or brand-centric phrase.

Moving to Step 3: Vocabulary Replacement.

Replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" (or "Coke moment") to tie the brand into the celebration. Alternatively, "soda" but that's too generic. Alternatively, "joy" but that's the persona's name. Wait, the persona's goal is to evoke joy, so maybe "joy" is the keyword. But the brand is Coca-Cola, so better to include their name.

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and [something]..." But need to keep the structure. Let's think of two sets:

Set 1: Replace "party" with "Coke moment" and "I want" with "we all want". That would make: "Life is a Coke moment, and we all want to live it that way." But "we all want" uses first-person plural (we), which is against the constraint. Wait, the constraint says to avoid first-person (I, we, me, etc.). So "we" is not allowed.

Alternative for the second part: "everyone wants" – still okay? Or "there's no better way" to remove first-person.

Hmm, maybe replace "I want" with "enjoy" or "choose". Let's try:

Set 1: Replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" and "I want" with "enjoy". So the quote becomes "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and enjoy to live it that way." That doesn't flow well. Maybe structure issues.

Alternatively, replacing just "party" with "Coca-Cola" would make: "Life is a Coca-Cola, and I want to live it that way." That doesn't make sense. 

Wait, perhaps replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola party". So: "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and I want to live it that way." But the first-person remains. Alternatively, changing "I want" to "everyone wants".

Set 1:
- "party" → "Coca-Cola moment" (so Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and...)
- "I want" → "everyone wants" (but "everyone" is okay, not first-person)

So the slogan: "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and everyone wants to live it that way." 

Set 2: Replace "party" with "joy" (from the persona's joy theme) and "I want" with "let’s live" (neutral). "Life is a joy, and let’s live it that way." But "joy" is the persona's goal, and "let's live" is better. But then where does Coca-Cola come in? Maybe that's not the best.

Alternatively, keep "party" as "Coca-Cola party" and "I want" → "there's no better way". So: "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and there's no better way to live it that way." Hmm, not great.

Alternatively, replace "party" with "Coca-Cola" and adjust the second part: "Life is a Coca-Cola, and you can live it that way." No, not right.

Hmm, maybe another approach. The original quote is "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way." To make it about Coca-Cola, perhaps:

"Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and you can live it that way." But need to ensure it's in third person.

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and everyone’s living it that way." That works better. 

Wait, the user allows replacing at most two words. Let me count:

Original quote: Life is a party, and I want to live it that way.

Option 1: Replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" (1 word), and "I want" with "everyone wants" (2 words). But that's two words, so allowed. 

So the sentence becomes: "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and everyone wants to live it that way." But "Coca-Cola moment" is two words replacing one, so maybe that's over? Wait, the instruction says "changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Original quote has "party" as one word. Replacing it with "Coca-Cola moment" is adding two words but replacing one. That might be over the limit. Let me check the exact wording:

"Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Ah, so each replacement counts as a change. So replacing "party" (1 word) with "Coca-Cola moment" (2 words) would count as changing 1 word to 2, which is an addition, so that counts as one replacement? Or each word in the replacement is a change? 

Wait, maybe the user means that the total number of words changed (i.e., replaced) is at most two. So replacing "party" with "Coke" is one word change. Or replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola" is two words for one, so that counts as one word replaced (since "party" is one word, and replacing with two words would count as a single replacement but adding words, which might be okay as long as total replaced words are within two.

Alternatively, to stay under two, maybe just replace "party" with "Coca-Cola" (one word for one), and then change "I want" to "you can" (two words for two words). Let's try:

"Life is a Coca-Cola, and you can live it that way." But "Coca-Cola" as a singular noun here doesn't fit. "Life is a Coca-Cola" sounds odd.

Alternatively, replace "party" with "Coke party", so two words replacing one. That would count as one replacement (since "party" is replaced with "Coke party"), so total changes: one. Then change "I want" to "everyone wants" (another change). So total two changes, which is allowed.

So slogan: "Life is a Coke party, and everyone wants to live it that way." 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and you can live it that way." 

But the rhythm might be off. Let's see:

Original: "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way."

Coca-Cola version: "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and you can live it that way."

That adds two words (Coca-Cola and party), replacing the original "party" with "Coca-Cola party", so that's a one-word replacement (original "party" becomes "Coca-Cola party", which is adding two words but replacing one word, so it counts as a single change? Not sure. Maybe safer to do "Coke party" as two words for "party", so replacing one with two, but counting as one change.

Alternatively, maybe the best approach is to replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" (two words) and keep the second part as "you can" instead of "I want". So two changes: replacing "party" (1 word → 2 words) and "I want" (2 words → "you can" (2 words)), so total two changes. That works.

So the replacements would be:

Set 1: "party" → "Coca-Cola moment" and "I want" → "you can"

Resulting in: "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and you can live it that way."

But "Coca-Cola moment" is three syllables (Coke-a-Cola mo-ment?), which might keep the rhythm. The original was "par-ty" (two syllables). "Coca-Cola" is four syllables, but maybe it flows.

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke moment..." which is shorter.

Alternatively, the best set would be replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola" and "I want" with "you can" (so two changes). "Life is a Coca-Cola, and you can live it that way." Hmm, but "a Coca-Cola" is awkward.

Hmm, perhaps the best option is to go with "Life is a Coca-Cola party, and you can live it that way." Even if it's a bit long, as long as the rhythm is kept.

Alternatively, the other set: replace "party" with "Coke moment" (two words replacing one, so one change), and "I want" with "there's no better way" (so replacing two words with four, which is over the limit). Probably better to stick to two changes.

Alright, moving to Step 4: Remix Generation.

Using the best replacement, which would be replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" and "I want" with "you can".

Final slogan: "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and you can live it that way."

Check constraints: No first-person. "You can" is okay. Brand name included. Syntax and meter preserved? Let's see:

Original: "Life is a party, and I want to live it that way."

Original syllables: 5 (Life is a par-ty) | 7 (and I want to live it that way)

Coca-Cola version: "Life is a Coke-la Cola mo-ment, and you can live it that way." Hmm, syllables might be longer. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola moment" is 5 syllables (Co-ca-Cola mo-ment). The second part: "and you can live it that way" is 7 syllables. Original second part was 7 syllables. So the meter is similar.

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and you can live it that way." That should work. 

Alternatively, another version from Set 2, but I think this is the best.
