Okay, let's tackle this for Coca-Cola with the trust persona. The goal is to emphasize safety or reliability. So first, I need three quotes that fit trust and Coca-Cola.

Hmm, classic quotes... Maybe something like "Trust falls"? Wait, that's an activity. Or maybe lyrics. Oh, "You've got a friend in me" from the movie Toy Story. That's about trust and reliability. The author is Randy Newman. Why? Because it suggests support and dependability, which aligns with Coca-Cola's approachable image.

Another one could be from The Beatles: "In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make." But that's more about reciprocity. Maybe not exactly trust. Wait, maybe a different song. "You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you might find you get what you need." Rolling Stones. Hmm, not sure if that fits trust. Maybe not the best.

Wait, there's "Trust in me, trust in me," from Disney's Lady and the Tramp. The song is "A Guy Like You." The lyrics include "Trust in me, trust in me." That's about trust and reliability. The author is Al Rinker and Jimmie Dodd. That could work because it's a direct appeal to trust, which fits the persona.

Third option: Maybe a saying like "When the going gets tough, the tough get going." But that's more about perseverance. Not trust. Hmm. Maybe a quote from a famous leader? Like "Trust is the glue of life." But that's more modern. Not sure if it's a classic. Maybe "The best things in life are free." But that's about value. Not exactly trust.

Wait, the user wants a quote, slang, lyric, or popular expression. So maybe "A diamond is forever" from De Beers, but that's a slogan already. Not a classic quote. Maybe "Diamonds are a girl's best friend" from the song by Marilyn Monroe. But that's more about jewelry. 

Alternatively, the Coca-Cola slogan itself is "Open Happiness," but that's existing. The user wants to remix a different quote. 

Wait, maybe "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return" from "My Way" by Frank Sinatra. But again, not exactly trust. 

Back to the first ideas. "You've got a friend in me" is good. "Trust in me" from Lady and the Tramp. Third could be "All you need is love" from The Beatles. But that's more about love than trust. 

Alternatively, maybe "The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want, drink what you don't like, and do what you'd rather not." But that's Oscar Wilde, and it's about health, not trust. 

Hmm. Let me think again. Maybe "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola" but that's not a classic quote. 

Wait, the user says "quote, slang, lyric, or popular expression". So maybe "You can trust your instincts" but not sure. 

Alternatively, the saying "Better safe than sorry" but that's more about caution. 

Wait, the user wants three sentences. Let me pick the two I have and think of a third. 

Third quote: "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade." But that's about optimism. 

Alternatively, "Safety first" from a popular saying. 

Wait, maybe the quote from The Hobbit: "The greatest reward is knowing you did something well." Not trust. 

Hmm, maybe "The truth will set you free" but that's more about honesty. 

Alternatively, the song "Stand By Me" by Ben E. King. The lyrics "When the night has come and the land is dark..." but the chorus is "And the music plays a soft melody." Not exactly trust. 

Wait, the song "Stand by Me" does have the line "So won't you stand by me?" which is about loyalty and trust. So that's a possible one. The author is Ben E. King. 

Okay, so three options:

1. "You've got a friend in me." Randy Newman. Matches because it's about reliability and friendship, which Coca-Cola can associate with being a trusted friend. ★

2. "Trust in me, trust in me." Lady and the Tramp (Al Rinker and Jimmie Dodd). Direct appeal to trust, fits the persona. 

3. "Stand by me" from Ben E. King's song. "When the night has come and the day is gone, I need you the most..." It's about loyalty. The quote could be "Stand by me, stand by me." 

Wait, but the exact lyric is "When the night has come and the land is still, my love will keep me warm..." but the chorus is "Stand by me, stand by me." So that's a possible quote. 

Comparing the three, the first one "You've got a friend in me" is more direct and positive, fitting Coca-Cola's friendly image. So I'll mark that as the best. 

Now, step 2: structure breakdown. The quote is "You've got a friend in me." Break into editable and fixed parts. 

Original quote: You've got a friend in me. 

To replace "friend" with a brand keyword, maybe "Cola" or "Coke" or "Coca-Cola". Also, "me" could be replaced. But the structure is "You've got a [noun] in [pronoun]." 

The brand name is Coca-Cola, so maybe "You've got a Cola in me?" No. Maybe "You've got a friend in Coke." But the structure needs to fit. Alternatively, replacing "friend" with "partner" but not sure. 

Alternatively, keeping "friend" and adding the brand. Like "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola." But the original structure is "You've got a friend in me." So replacing "me" with "Coca-Cola". 

Wait, the user wants to end with the brand. Maybe the structure would be "You've got a [blank] in [blank]." The brand name can replace one of the words. 

So the structure breakdown would be: You've got | a friend | in | me. 

The editable parts are "friend" and "me". 

Why? "Friend" can be replaced with a synonym that aligns with the brand (e.g., "Cola"), and "me" can be replaced with the brand name (Coca-Cola). But the brand name is longer. 

Alternatively, replacing "friend" with "Coca-Cola" but that might not fit. 

Hmm, maybe better to keep "friend" and replace "me" with "Coca-Cola". 

So the fixed parts are "You've got" and "in". The editable parts are "friend" and "me". 

So the structure breakdown would be: You've got | a friend | in | me. 

Then, replacements: 

First idea: "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola." But the original structure has "in me", so replacing "me" with "Coca-Cola". 

Second idea: "You've got a Cola in me." Doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, changing "friend" to "partner" and "me" to "Coke". "You've got a partner in Coke." 

But the goal is to include the brand name. Maybe "You've got a friend in every Coca-Cola." Hmm, but that changes more words. 

Wait, the user says to replace at most two words. The original quote is 5 words. Let's see:

Original: "You've got a friend in me."

Possible replacements:

Option 1: "You've got a Cola in me." (replace "friend" with "Cola") – but that doesn't make sense. 

Option 2: "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola." (replace "me" with "Coca-Cola") – that's replacing "me" with the brand name. 

Alternatively, replacing "a friend" with "Coca-Cola" but that would be two words? Wait, "a friend" is two words. Maybe "You've got Coca-Cola in me." No, that's awkward. 

Hmm, perhaps the best is to replace "me" with "Coca-Cola". So "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola." That's replacing "me" with "Coca-Cola". The structure is kept: "You've got a [noun] in [brand]." 

Another option: "You've got a partner in Coke." Replacing "friend" with "partner" and "me" with "Coke". 

But the user wants to keep the rhythm. Original has 6 syllables? Let's count:

"You've got a friend in me." 6 syllables. 

"You've got a friend in Coca-Cola" would be more syllables. "Coca-Cola" is 3 syllables. "Coke" is 1. So "You've got a friend in Coke." That's 6 syllables. 

That might work. 

So possible replacements:

Set 1: "friend" → "Cola", "me" → "Coca-Cola" (but too long). 

Set 2: "me" → "Coca-Cola" → "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola." 

Set 3: "me" → "Coke" → "You've got a friend in Coke." 

The second option with "Coke" is shorter and keeps the meter. 

Alternatively, "You've got a Coca-Cola in me." Not good. 

Hmm. So best is replacing "me" with "Coca-Cola" even if it's longer. Or "Coke". 

The user says to end with punctuation, so the final slogan would need a period or exclamation. 

Now, the remix slogan should include the brand name, keep structure, and end with punctuation. 

So the final slogan could be: "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola." But is that the best? 

Alternatively, using "partner" instead of "friend": "You've got a partner in Coca-Cola." But "friend" is better for trust. 

Alternatively, "You've got a Cola in me." No. 

Wait, maybe the other quote "Trust in me" could be better? Let's see. 

Original quote "Trust in me, trust in me." 

Structure: Trust in | me | , | trust in | me. 

But the user wants to replace words. Maybe "Trust in Coca-Cola, trust in me." But that still includes "me". Not sure. 

Alternatively, replacing "me" with "Coca-Cola" in both places: "Trust in Coca-Cola, trust in Coca-Cola." Not good. 

Hmm, maybe the first quote is better. 

So going back, the best is "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola." 

But let me check the user constraints: no first person. The quote uses "you've got", which is second person, so that's okay. The brand is mentioned, not the narrator. 

Yes, that works. 

So steps are:

Step 1: three quotes with the best being "You've got a friend in me".

Step 2: structure breakdown with | separators.

Step 3: replacements to "me" as "Coca-Cola" or "Coke".

Step 4: the slogan using the best replacement.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "You've got a friend in me." — Randy Newman ★  
Why: Directly evokes reliability and companionship, aligning with Coca-Cola’s warm, trustworthy image.  

Structure: You've got | a friend | in | me.  
Editable parts: "friend" (noun) and "me" (pronoun).  
Replaceable keywords: "friend" → trust-related synonyms or "Coca-Cola"; "me" → brand name.  

Replacements:  
Set 1: "friend" → "partner", "me" → "Coca-Cola" → "You've got a partner in Coca-Cola."  
*Rationale*: "Partner" implies collaboration, and "Coca-Cola" replaces "me" to highlight brand reliability.  

Remix Slogan: "You've got a partner in Coca-Cola."

Okay, I need to create a slogan for Coca-Cola using the "Trust" persona, emphasizing safety and reliability. Let's start with Step 1: Quote Matching.

First, I should find three quotes that fit trust and safety. The brand is Coca-Cola, so maybe something classic and reassuring. 

The first quote that comes to mind is from the Bible, "Trust in the Lord with all your heart..." because it's about trust and reliability, which aligns with Coca-Cola's trustworthy image. But maybe too religious?

Next, the Beatles lyric "All You Need Is Love." Love is about connection, but how does that tie to trust and safety? Maybe not the best fit, but it's a popular and positive message.

Another option is "Safety in Numbers," a common saying. It directly relates to safety, which matches the persona's goal. But is it as memorable for a slogan?

Hmm, maybe "The Road to Serfdom" by Hayek? No, that's more about political systems. Not right.

Wait, "Better safe than sorry" is another common saying about safety, but maybe not as strong. 

Alternatively, "A diamond is forever" from De Beers, but that's about permanence. 

Wait, the user said to list three quotes. Let me pick the top three:

1. "Trust in the Lord..." from Proverbs. Explaining that it's about unwavering trust, which Coca-Cola can represent as a reliable product.

2. "Safety in Numbers" by Unknown. It's about reliability in a group, so Coca-Cola as a trusted brand among many.

3. The Beatles' "All You Need Is Love" because love can symbolize the comfort and reliability of Coca-Cola. 

Wait, but "Safety in Numbers" might be better for safety. Maybe the best match is "Trust in the Lord" because it's directly about trust, but the author might not want religious references. Alternatively, "Safety in Numbers" could be the best since it's more secular and directly addresses safety. 

Wait, the persona is Trust, so the first quote might be better. Let me structure them:

First quote: Proverbs 3:5: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart..." because it emphasizes total trust, aligning with Coca-Cola's reliability. 

Second: "Safety in Numbers" because it suggests reliability in a trusted group or brand. 

Third: "The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it." Oscar Wilde. Hmm, no, that's not trust. Maybe "Better safe than sorry" instead. 

Wait, maybe "All the world's a stage" is not about trust. Let me think again. 

Alternatively, "The best things in life are free" by Haskells, but that's about value, not trust. 

Another idea: "The early bird catches the worm" – no. 

Hmm, maybe "You can't go wrong with..." but that's a phrase. 

Wait, "Just do it" is Nike. Not relevant. 

Maybe "Share a Coke and a smile." But that's their existing slogan. Need to find external quotes. 

Wait, perhaps the song lyric "When you're smiling, the whole world smiles with you." But not exactly trust. 

Alternatively, "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." Socrates – not helpful here. 

Perhaps "Home is where the heart is." But not trust. 

Hmm, maybe "A friend in need is a friend indeed." But that's more about friendship. 

Alternatively, "In God we trust" – but again religious. 

Alternatively, "Trust me," from various sources. 

Wait, maybe "Trust yourself" by Ralph Waldo Emerson. "To trust yourself is the first secret of success." But that's more about self-trust. 

Alternatively, "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." Nelson Mandela. Not exactly trust. 

Hmm, perhaps the Beatles lyric "All You Need Is Love" is the best fit for warmth and reliability, even if not directly about safety. 

Alternatively, "Safety first" from a slogan. 

Okay, I think I'll go with three quotes:

1. Proverbs 3:5 – "Trust in the Lord with all your heart..." (trust, reliability) ★ (best match because of direct trust theme)

2. "Safety in Numbers" – common saying (safety through reliability in a group)

3. "All You Need Is Love" – The Beatles (emotional trust and comfort)

Now, in Step 2, I need to structure the best one, which is the Proverbs quote. 

Breaking down the quote: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart..." into editable parts. 

Original: Trust in the Lord with all your heart.

The fixed parts would be "Trust in the ... with all your heart." The editable parts are "Lord" and maybe "Trust" itself? But the brand is Coca-Cola. 

Alternatively, maybe replace "Lord" with a brand-related term. Since Coca-Cola is a product, maybe "the moment" or "every sip" or "Coca-Cola"?

Wait, the goal is to emphasize safety/reliability. So replacing "Lord" with something like "Coca-Cola" or "our promise" to maintain the trust. 

In Step 3, replacing words. Since we can only change up to two words. Let's see:

Original: Trust in the Lord with all your heart.

Possible replacements:

1. Replace "Lord" with "Coca-Cola" → "Trust in Coca-Cola with all your heart." 

2. Replace "Lord" with "every sip" → "Trust in every sip with all your heart."

But "every sip" might not directly convey reliability. Alternatively, "Trust in our promise with all your heart" but "our" is first person, which is not allowed. 

Wait the constraints say not to use first-person. So the brand name can be inserted. 

Alternatively, "Trust in Coca-Cola’s promise with all your heart." But that adds more words. The original is "Trust in the Lord...", so maybe "Trust in Coca-Cola with all your heart." 

Alternatively, "Trust in every moment with Coca-Cola." But that changes structure.

Hmm, need to keep the structure as close as possible. Let's try:

Original structure breakdown: Trust in | the Lord | with all your heart.

Editable parts are "the Lord" and maybe "Trust in". But changing "Trust in" to "Trust Coca-Cola" would replace two words? "Trust Coca-Cola with all your heart." 

Alternatively, "Trust in Coca-Cola’s promise with all your heart" but that's more words. 

Wait, the original quote has "Trust in the Lord..." so maybe replacing "the Lord" with "Coca-Cola’s promise". 

But "Coca-Cola’s" has an apostrophe and maybe that's okay. 

Alternatively, "Trust in Coca-Cola with all your heart." That's replacing "Lord" with "Coca-Cola". 

Alternatively, "Trust in every moment with all your heart, Coca-Cola." But not sure. 

Maybe the best is to keep the structure: "Trust in [brand] with all your heart." So replacing "Lord" with "Coca-Cola" gives "Trust in Coca-Cola with all your heart."

Alternatively, to make it more about reliability, maybe "Trust in Coca-Cola’s reliability with all your heart." But that's adding words beyond the limit. 

The user allows replacing up to two words. Original quote has "the Lord". So replacing "Lord" with "Coca-Cola" is one word change. 

Wait, "the Lord" is two words. So replacing both "the" and "Lord" with "Coca-Cola" would be two words. 

Original: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart."

Breaking down: Trust in | the Lord | with all your heart.

So "the Lord" can be replaced by "Coca-Cola", changing two words. That's within the limit. 

So the replacement would be "Trust in Coca-Cola with all your heart." 

Another option: "Trust in every moment with all your heart." Replacing "the Lord" with "every moment" – but "moment" relates to occasions where Coca-Cola is consumed. 

Alternatively, "Trust in safety with all your heart, Coca-Cola." Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe "Trust in the moment" as a phrase, but not sure. 

Step 3: Replacements could be "Coca-Cola" or "every sip" or "our promise".

Now, the Remix Slogan should end with punctuation, neutral perspective, and include the brand. 

So the final slogan would be "Trust in Coca-Cola with all your heart." 

But does that make sense? It's a bit direct. Alternatively, "Trust in every moment with all your heart, Coca-Cola." 

Wait, the structure needs to preserve the meter. The original is "Trust in the Lord with all your heart." 

"Trust in Coca-Cola with all your heart." The syllable count: "Trust in the Lord" (4 syllables) vs. "Coca-Cola" (4 syllables). So the meter stays. 

Yes, that works. 

Alternatively, "Trust in every sip with all your heart." But that's more about drinking. 

I think the first replacement is better. 

So putting it all together:

Step 1:

1. Proverbs 3:5: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding." ★ Best match because it emphasizes unwavering trust, aligning with Coca-Cola's reliability.

2. "Safety in numbers" (common saying): Highlights collective reliability, fitting for a trusted brand.

3. The Beatles: "All you need is love." Suggests emotional comfort and trust, linking to Coca-Cola's comforting presence.

Step 2:

Structure: Trust in | the Lord | with all your heart.

Replaceable parts: "the Lord" (brand keyword), and possibly "Trust in" if needed, but likely just the first part.

Step 3:

Replacements: 

- "the Lord" → "Coca-Cola" (directly replaces to associate trust with the brand)

Step 4:

Final slogan: "Trust in Coca-Cola with all your heart."
</think>

Explanation:  
1. Proverbs 3:5: "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding." ★ Matches because it emphasizes total trust and reliance, mirroring Coca-Cola’s role as a consistently reliable product.  
2. "Safety in numbers" (common saying): Matches through its theme of collective reliability, aligning with Coca-Cola’s trusted presence in shared moments.  
3. The Beatles: "All you need is love." Matches by evoking emotional comfort and universal trust, resonating with Coca-Cola’s nostalgic appeal.  

Structure:  
Trust in | the Lord | with all your heart.  
Editable parts: "the Lord" (replaceable with brand keyword).  

Replacements:  
1. "the Lord" → "Coca-Cola" (directly links trust to the brand name).  

Remix Slogan: "Trust in Coca-Cola with all your heart."

--- Pass 3 (valid) ---
Okay, so I need to come up with three quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand and the trust persona. Let's think. Coca-Cola is all about reliability, tradition, and being a consistent part of people's lives. The persona is trust, so the quotes should evoke safety and dependability.

First, maybe "The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing." Wait, that's more about inaction. Not sure. Hmm. Maybe "You can't go wrong with a classic." That's from somewhere, but I'm not sure who the author is. Classic aligns with Coca-Cola's long history. 

Or "The best things in life are free, but you have to buy the others." Not sure the author. But that's about value, maybe not trust. Alternatively, "The early bird catches the worm" – no, that's more about timing. 

Wait, the user wants quotes, slang, lyrics, or popular expressions. Maybe "Trust me, I'm a doctor." But that's more about authority. Alternatively, "Real magic comes from within." From the Wizard of Oz? "You're never fully dressed without a smile." That's a quote from Diana Vreeland. But how does that tie into trust?

Wait, another thought: "You can always count on me." That's a slogan itself. But maybe from a movie? Or "It's the real thing." That's actually a Coca-Cola slogan already. Oh right, but the user wants to remix a classic quote, not their existing slogans. So need something else.

Hmm, maybe "A diamond is forever" from De Beers. But that's about permanence. Could work for trust. Author is De Beers, but maybe not. Alternatively, "Just do it." No, that's Nike. 

Wait, the song "Always On My Mind" – but that's more about love. "Just what the doctor ordered" – implies reliability. Author is from a song or old saying. 

Wait, let's think of trust-related quotes. "Trust is the glue of life." by Maya Angelou. That's good. So maybe that's one. 

Second, "You can't build trust on a foundation of fear." Maybe from a book? Not sure. Third, "Trust is earned, not demanded." Maybe from someone like H. Jackson Brown Jr. 

Wait, need three quotes with authors. Let me check:

1. "Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships." – Stephen Covey. 

2. "Trust yourself." – Lao Tzu.

3. "The only way to have a friend is to be one." – Ralph Waldo Emerson. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the quote "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." – Ernest Hemingway. That's a good one.

Wait, maybe the best quote is "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." by Hemingway. Because Coca-Cola can be associated with trust. 

Alternatively, the "Real magic comes from within" from the Wizard of Oz. That's more about authenticity, which ties into trust. 

Wait, the user wants three quotes. Let's try:

1. "You can always count on me." – Unknown, but maybe from a movie. Author could be listed as Unknown. The reason is that Coca-Cola is a reliable product people can depend on. 

2. "Trust is the foundation of life." – Stephen Covey. Because Coca-Cola builds trust through consistent quality. 

3. "The early bird gets the worm." – Proverb. But that's not about trust. Maybe not. 

Alternatively, "A diamond is forever." – De Beers. Author is Frances Gerety. The reason: diamonds symbolize permanence and trust. 

Alternatively, "The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing." – Edmund Burke. But that's about inaction. Not sure. 

Hmm, maybe "The truth will set you free." – John 8:32. But that's religious. 

Alternatively, "Just do it." – Nike. No, not the right author. 

Wait, maybe the song lyric "You can leave your hat on" from "The Look of Love". Not sure. 

Wait, perhaps "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return." – from "My Way". Not sure. 

Alternatively, "I believe in you." – unknown. 

Wait, let me think again. The goal is to emphasize safety or reliability. So quotes that talk about reliability, dependability, trust. 

Another option: "You can't go wrong with a classic." – unknown. Author might be a slogan somewhere. The reasoning is that Coca-Cola is a classic product people trust because it's reliable. 

Alternatively, "Trust in yourself." – from a song? Maybe. 

Wait, here's a better one: "Trust is the glue of life." – Stephen Covey. That's a solid quote. 

So compiling three:

1. "Trust is the glue of life." – Stephen Covey. Why: Emphasizes trust as foundational, aligning with Coca-Cola's reliability. 

2. "You can always count on me." – Unknown. Why: Suggests dependability, which matches Coca-Cola's consistent quality. 

3. "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." – Ernest Hemingway. Why: Encourages trust through action, which Coca-Cola embodies in their consistent product. 

Now, which is the best? The first one (Stephen Covey) directly states trust's importance, which fits well. So mark that with ★. 

Wait, but the user wants the quotes to be from authors. So the three quotes would be:

1. "You can always count on me." (Unknown) – about dependability.

2. "Trust is the glue of life." (Stephen Covey) – foundational trust.

3. "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." (Ernest Hemingway) – about trusting through action.

Which is the best fit? The second one (Covey) directly connects trust to life's foundation, which Coca-Cola as a trusted brand can be part of that. The first one is more personal. The third is a bit more about interpersonal trust, while Coca-Cola's trust is product-related. So I'll pick the Covey quote as best. 

Okay, now Step 1 done. Now Step 2: structure breakdown. 

Take the ★ quote: "Trust is the glue of life." 

Need to break it into fixed and editable parts. The goal is to replace words with brand keywords. 

Original: "Trust is the glue of life."

Possible structure: "Trust | is the | glue | of | life."

The editable parts could be "Trust", "glue", "life". 

The brand is Coca-Cola, so replacing "glue" with something related to the product, like "Coca-Cola" or "refreshment". But since the user wants to keep syntax, maybe replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" and "life" with "every moment" or similar. 

Wait, but the structure breakdown requires separating with |. Let me think again. 

Structure: Trust | is the | glue | of | life. 

Fixed parts: "is the", "of"

Editable parts: Trust, glue, life. 

The brand needs to be included. So perhaps replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" to say "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." But that might not make sense. Alternatively, "Trust is the essence of life, with Coca-Cola." Hmm. 

Alternatively, replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola" and keeping "life", making it "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." But that's a bit forced. 

Alternatively, replacing "glue" with "essence" but that's not brand-related. 

Wait, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life, refreshing every moment." But that's adding more. 

Alternatively, maybe replace "life" with "every sip" or "every moment". Like "Trust is the glue of every sip (of Coca-Cola)." No, not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." If "Coca-Cola" replaces "glue". 

Alternatively, the structure breakdown could be: 

Original quote: "Trust is the glue of life."

Breakdown: |Trust| is the |glue| of |life|. 

Suggest that "Trust" can be replaced with the brand name, or "glue" replaced with something like "Coca-Cola", but that might not fit. Alternatively, replace "glue" with "safety" or "reliability", but that's not brand-specific. 

Alternatively, keep "glue" and replace "life" with "your moments" and add "with Coca-Cola". 

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to keep "Trust" and replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" and "life" with "every moment" but that might be too much. The user says to change at most two words plus adding the brand name. 

Wait the instruction for Step 3 says: "Propose 1-2 replacement word/phrase sets with short reasons. Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So adding the brand name counts as a change. So for example, if the original is 5 words, changing two and adding the brand name would be three changes, but the user allows at most two words changed plus the brand? Wait the exact constraint is "changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So total changes (including the brand name addition) can't exceed two word substitutions plus the brand name. Wait maybe it's better to think that changing two words plus adding the brand counts as three substitutions. Wait the instruction says "at most two words from the original quote" plus adding the brand name also counts. 

Wait the user's instruction for Step 3: "Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So total changes (words replaced in the original) plus the brand name inclusion can't exceed two replacements. So, for example, replacing one word and adding the brand name counts as two. 

So, in the original quote "Trust is the glue of life," the brand name can be inserted, but replacing two words at max. 

So possible replacements: 

Option 1: Replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" and "life" with "every moment". That would be two changes, plus adding "Coca-Cola". Wait no, "Coca-Cola" replaces "glue", so that's one change. Then "life" to "every moment" is second. So two changes, plus adding the brand name is part of the replacement. 

Wait maybe better to think:

Option 1: "Trust is the Coca-Cola of every moment." Here, replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola" (one change) and "life" with "every moment" (second change). That's two substitutions, and the brand name is part of the first. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the glue of life." Here, replacing "Trust" with "Coca-Cola", and keeping the rest. That's one substitution. But "glue" remains, which might not be ideal. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." Replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola", so one substitution. That's better. 

Wait, but the original quote is "Trust is the glue of life." So if we replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola", the slogan becomes "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." That's one substitution (changing "glue" to "Coca-Cola") and adding the brand name there. 

Alternatively, replacing "life" with "every moment" and "glue" with "essence", but that's two substitutions without brand. 

Hmm. The key is to include the brand name while keeping the structure. 

So the best option might be to replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola", so the slogan is "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." That's one substitution, keeping the structure. 

Alternatively, maybe replacing "Trust" with "Coca-Cola" gives "Coca-Cola is the glue of life." But that changes the meaning. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the Coca-Cola glue of life." But that's awkward. 

Hmm. Alternatively, "Trust is the essence, Coca-Cola of life." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the glue of life—Coca-Cola." Adding the brand name at the end. That way, the original quote is kept, and the brand is tacked on. But the user says to include the brand name in the slogan, so that might work. 

Wait, the original quote is "Trust is the glue of life." Adding "Coca-Cola" at the end would make it "Trust is the glue of life, Coca-Cola." But that might not be as strong. 

Alternatively, replacing "glue" with "essence" and then adding "Coca-Cola" at the end: "Trust is the essence of life, Coca-Cola." But that's two substitutions (glue→essence, plus adding the brand). 

Hmm, perhaps the best is to do one substitution (changing "glue" to "Coca-Cola") resulting in "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." That keeps the original structure and rhythm, and fits the trust and reliability angle. 

So Step 3: Replacements. 

Propose two sets:

1. Replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." Reason: directly associates Coca-Cola with being the essential component of trust, maintaining the metaphor. 

2. Replace "glue" with "essence" and add "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the essence of life, Coca-Cola." But that's two substitutions plus the brand? Wait, "glue" becomes "essence" (one substitution), then adding "Coca-Cola" at the end counts as a second substitution? Or is adding the brand name considered an addition not counted as substitution. The instruction says "changing at most two words from the original quote" so the "adding" part is separate. 

Wait the user says "adding the brand name also counts towards this limit." So if you replace one word and add the brand name, that's two. 

In option 1, replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola" is one substitution (since "Coca-Cola" replaces "glue"), so that's one change. 

In option 2, replacing "glue" with "essence" and adding "Coca-Cola" at the end would be two changes (one substitution and adding the brand counts as the second). 

Alternatively, replacing "life" with "your moments" and adding "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the glue of your moments, Coca-Cola." Two substitutions (glue→Coca-Cola? No, wait, "life" to "your moments" is one, then adding the brand as second. 

This is getting a bit tangled. 

Alternatively, maybe the best option is the first: replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola", resulting in "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." 

Then Step 4 would use that as the final slogan. 

So putting it all together:

Step 1: 

1. "You can always count on me." – Unknown. Matches because it suggests dependability, aligning with Coca-Cola's consistent reliability.

2. ★ "Trust is the glue of life." – Stephen Covey. Matches as it directly frames trust as foundational, which Coca-Cola's reliability embodies.

3. "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." – Ernest Hemingway. Matches by emphasizing trust through action, akin to Coca-Cola’s trusted presence.

Step 2: 

Structure: Trust | is the | glue | of | life.

Editable parts are "Trust", "glue", "life".

Step 3:

Replacements: 

1. Replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." (1 substitution, brand name as replacement).

Reason: Directly ties Coca-Cola to the role of trust's essential element.

2. Replace "life" with "every moment" and add "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the glue of every moment, Coca-Cola." (two substitutions: "life" → "every moment" and adding "Coca-Cola").

Reason: Highlights reliability across moments with brand mention.

Step 4: Choosing the first replacement for simplicity and brand prominence.

Final slogan: "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life."

Wait but does that make sense? "The glue of life" is saying trust holds things together. If you replace glue with Coca-Cola, it's saying Coca-Cola holds life together, which is a bit strong. Maybe better to keep "glue" and add the brand. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola is the glue of trust in every moment." But that changes the structure. 

Hmm, perhaps a better structure is to keep "glue" and insert "Coca-Cola" elsewhere. 

Wait the original quote is "Trust is the glue of life." If we want to keep "glue" as is, maybe change "Trust" to "Coca-Cola is the glue of trust in life." No, that's not right. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: the glue of trust in life." But that's changing more structure. 

Alternatively, the first option might be the best even if it's a bit forced. 

Alternatively, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." implies that Coca-Cola is the essential component of trust, which fits the brand's reliability. 

Alternatively, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life—refreshing always." But that adds more. 

Hmm. Given the constraints, the first option is probably acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola glue of life." But that's awkward. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the essence, Coca-Cola of life." No. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life's moments." 

Hmm. The key is to keep the structure as close as possible. The original has "Trust is the glue of life." So keeping the same structure but replacing "glue" with the brand. 

I think that's the best path forward.

Remix Slogan: "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life."

--- Pass 4 (valid) ---
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants a slogan for Coca-Cola that emphasizes trust, safety, or reliability. They mentioned not to include the persona name but to reflect the mood through the wording. 

Starting with Step 1: Quote Matching. I need three quotes that fit the trust and reliability theme for Coca-Cola. The quotes should be from known sources, authors included.

First, maybe "Trust is built over time and destroyed overnight." That's a common saying, but who said it? I think it's from someone like Warren Buffett. It emphasizes building trust gradually, which aligns with Coca-Cola's long-standing reputation.

Second, "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." Steve Jobs. Hmm, not sure that's about trust. Maybe not the best fit. Wait, maybe another quote. How about "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." But that's more about courage. Not trust.

Wait, another possibility: "You can't build a reputation on what you are not." From W. Clement Stone. That's about consistency and reliability, which fits trust. 

Third, "Safety is everyone's responsibility." A common slogan in safety contexts. But maybe too generic. Alternatively, "Safety first" is a well-known phrase, but the author might be hard to trace. Maybe better to pick something more recognized.

Alternatively, "The best things in life are free." But that's more about value. Hmm. Maybe "Trust is the glue of life." From Maya Angelou. Yes, that's better. She did say something like that. 

Wait, checking: Maya Angelou's exact quote is "Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds relationships." That's perfect. 

So three quotes:

1. "Trust is built over time and destroyed overnight." (Warren Buffett) - Because it highlights the importance of maintaining trust through consistency, which Coca-Cola has done for decades.
2. "The best things in life are free, but you have to buy the better things." (A. A. Milne) Wait, but that's about value, not trust. Maybe not. Let me think again. 
Wait, maybe "Safety in numbers." But that's a proverb. 

Alternatively, "The customer is always right." But that's a business motto. Maybe not. 

Hmm. Let me re-arrange. 

Option 1: Maya Angelou's quote about trust as glue. That's strong for reliability. 

Option 2: Warren Buffett's trust building over time. 

Option 3: "Safety first" as a common saying. But maybe not attributed. 

Alternatively, "When in doubt, trust." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Trust yourself." Ralph Waldo Emerson. But that's more personal. 

Hmm. Let me finalize three. 

1. Maya Angelou's "Trust is the glue of life." (★)
2. Warren Buffett's "Trust is built over time..."
3. "Nothing is as strong as tempered trust." (Aeschylus) 

Wait, Aeschylus? Let me confirm. Actually, the quote "Nothing is stronger than tempered trust." is from Sophocles. Wait, maybe it's Aeschylus. Either way, it's a classic quote. 

Alternatively, maybe "You can't buy trust, but you can pay a fortune for it." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Trust, once broken, is difficult to reestablish." That's the opposite of building. 

Hmm. Let's pick three with authors. 

So for Step 1, three quotes:

1. "Trust is the glue of life." - Maya Angelou. Matches because it underscores the foundational role of trust in enduring relationships, much like Coca-Cola's role in everyday moments.
2. "Trust is built over time and destroyed overnight." - Warren Buffett. Aligns with Coca-Cola's long-term reliability.
3. "Nothing is stronger than tempered trust." - Sophocles. Emphasizes strength through trust, fitting for a trusted brand.

Marking the first one as ★ because it's more poetic and fits the "glue" metaphor which can be adapted to Coca-Cola's role in bringing people together.

Moving to Step 2: Structure Breakdown. Take the ★ quote. 

Original: "Trust is the glue of life." 

Breaking into parts: Trust | is the glue | of life. 

Which words can be replaced? "Trust" with Coca-Cola? Or "glue" with something related to the brand? The brand name could be inserted in place of "Trust". But since the user wants to include brand name, maybe replace "Trust" with "Coca-Cola" and "glue" with a term that signifies their role. Or "glue of life" could become "glue of every moment" or something. 

Step 3: Replacements. 

Option 1: Replace "Trust" with "Coca-Cola" and "glue" with "joy" or "refreshment". But "glue" is a metaphor, so maybe keep "glue of [something related]". 

Option 2: Keep "Trust" as part of the slogan but add the brand name. Like "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life's moments." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the glue of life." That's straightforward but maybe too direct. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: the glue of every moment." 

Hmm. The original quote's structure is [Trust] is the glue of [life]. To keep the structure, maybe replace "Trust" with "Coca-Cola" and "life" with a Coca-Cola-related term. 

So, "Coca-Cola is the glue of life's moments." That adds "moments" which is a common theme for the brand. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the glue of shared joy." 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: the glue of trust in every moment." 

Wait, but the user says to limit replacing to two words max. So in the original quote, "Trust is the glue of life." The words that can be replaced are "Trust" (with Coca-Cola?), "glue" (maybe a brand action?), and "life" (maybe "moments" or "everyday"). 

Option 1: Replace "Trust" with "Coca-Cola" and "life" with "moments": "Coca-Cola is the glue of moments." 

But that loses the "life" part. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the glue of life's moments." 

Alternatively, replacing "glue" with "joy": "Coca-Cola is the joy of life." But that's changing two words. 

Alternatively, replacing "glue" with "essence" and "life" with "happiness": but that might be too much. 

The key is to keep the structure and rhythm. Original is 8 syllables: "Trust is the glue of life." (Trust (1) is (1) the (1) glue (1) of (1) life (1) – total 6? Maybe. )

So, "Coca-Cola is the essence of life." (Coca-Cola (3) is (1) the (1) essence (2) of (1) life (1). ) That's 8 syllables. 

Hmm. Maybe "Coca-Cola: the glue of life's shared moments." 

Alternatively, sticking closer to the original structure, replacing "Trust" with "Coca-Cola" and "glue" with "spark" or "joy": 

"Coca-Cola is the spark of life." 

But maybe "Coca-Cola is the glue of life's moments." 

Alternatively, keeping "glue" as is and replacing "Trust" with "Coca-Cola" and adding the brand name: 

"Coca-Cola: the glue of life." 

That's concise but maybe too direct. 

In the final slogan, the user requires including the brand name or keyword, and not using first-person. So "Coca-Cola is the glue of life's moments." might work. 

Alternatively, "The glue of life's moments: Coca-Cola." 

But the original structure is "Trust is the glue of life." So keeping the same structure but replacing "Trust" with "Coca-Cola", the slogan would be: 

"Coca-Cola is the glue of life's moments." 

That adds "moments" to make it more specific to Coca-Cola's moments. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the glue of every moment." 

Yes, that's better. 

So the replacements would be: 

Original: Trust | is the glue | of life.

Replace "Trust" with "Coca-Cola", and "life" with "every moment". 

Thus, the structure breakdown is: 

Trust | is the glue | of life.

So editable parts are the first and third segments. 

In replacements, changing "Trust" to "Coca-Cola" and "life" to "every moment".

So the final slogan would be: "Coca-Cola is the glue of every moment."

Checking constraints: no first-person, includes brand name, ends with period. 

Yes, that works. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola: the glue of life's every moment." but "every" might be redundant. 

Hmm, "every moment" is concise. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the glue of every shared moment." 

But maybe "shared" is adding a word. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the glue of life’s moments." 

Using "life's moments" instead of "every moment". 

The original quote's "life" is singular, so "life's moments" keeps the possessive. 

So the final slogan could be: "Coca-Cola is the glue of life’s moments."

That's better. 

So steps:

Step 1: The three quotes, with Maya's as ★.

Step 2: Break into Trust | is the glue | of life.

Step 3: Replace "Trust" with "Coca-Cola" and "life" with "life’s moments".

Step4: Final slogan "Coca-Cola is the glue of life’s moments."

I think that fits all constraints.
</think>

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. "Trust is the glue of life." – Maya Angelou  
   Why: Highlights trust as a foundational, binding force, aligning with Coca-Cola’s role as a unifying, enduring presence.  
   ★ Best match.  

2. "Safety is everyone’s responsibility." – Unknown proverb  
   Why: Focuses on collective responsibility, mirroring Coca-Cola’s reliability in everyday moments.  

3. "Trust is built over time and destroyed overnight." – Warren Buffett  
   Why: Emphasizes longevity, reflecting Coca-Cola’s consistent quality.  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Structure: **Trust** | is the glue | of **life**.  
Editable parts: "Trust" (brand/product association) and "life" (contextualizes Coca-Cola’s role in daily moments).  

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
1. Replace "Trust" → **Coca-Cola** and "life" → **every shared moment**  
   Reason: Positions Coca-Cola as the unifying force in personal and communal experiences.  

Step 4【Remix Generation】  
Remix Slogan: "Coca-Cola is the glue of every shared moment."  

Explanation: The slogan retains Maya Angelou’s poetic structure while inserting Coca-Cola as the metaphorical "glue," emphasizing its role in connecting people through trusted, universal moments. The phrase "every shared moment" replaces "life," narrowing the focus to Coca-Cola’s presence in everyday experiences.

--- Pass 5 (valid) ---
Okay, I need to create a slogan for Coca-Cola that emphasizes safety and reliability using a remix of a classic quote. Let me start with Step 1: Quote Matching. The persona is Trust, and the brand is Coca-Cola, so the quotes should reflect safety and reliability.

First, I'll think of quotes that are about trust or reliability. Maybe some famous lines from literature or songs. Let me brainstorm. 

One classic quote that comes to mind is "Diamonds are forever," by Marilyn Monroe. Wait, but that's more about permanence and diamonds. Hmm. Maybe "Diamonds are forever" can be adapted? Not sure yet. Alternatively, the Nike slogan "Just Do It" isn't really about trust. Maybe a different angle.

Wait, the user wants quotes, slang, lyrics, or popular expressions. Let me think of lyrics. The Beatles' "All You Need is Love" is about love, but maybe not trust. How about "The best things in life are free," from the song by that name? That's about value and reliability. But the connection to trust might be a stretch. 

Another thought: "The buck stops here," by Harry S. Truman. That's about taking responsibility, which relates to trust. But it's a bit old. Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with..." that's a common saying. Like "You can't go wrong with a classic." But that's more of a slogan than a quote.

Wait, the user mentioned "popular expression," so maybe "Safety first" is an option, but that's more of a motto. Maybe "Better safe than sorry." That's a common expression about reliability. 

Alternatively, "Trust in me" from a song? Like "Trust in me, trust in me, that's all I ask of you," from The King and I. That's direct but maybe too on the nose. 

Another possibility: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do," by Steve Jobs. Hmm, not about trust. 

Wait, maybe "The real thing" itself is a Coca-Cola slogan. But the user wants to remix a different quote. 

Let me think again. The goal is to emphasize safety or reliability. So quotes that convey reliability. 

Maybe "You can always count on me" – but that's more personal. The brand is Coca-Cola, so maybe a quote that can be adapted to them. 

Wait, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return," from The Beatles. Not exactly trust. 

Hmm. Let me look for quotes about trust or reliability. 

"The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step" is about perseverance, but maybe not. 

Alternatively, "The customer is always right," but that's a business adage. 

Wait, maybe "It's the real thing" from Coca-Cola's existing slogan, but the user wants a new remix. 

Wait, the user wants three sentences that fit the persona and brand. Let me list possible options:

1. "The real thing." That's Coca-Cola's own, but maybe too close. 

2. "Trust in the journey," but not sure. 

Wait, perhaps "The best things in life are free" (as a popular song lyric). That's about value, but maybe "the best things are reliable" or something. 

Alternatively, "Diamonds are forever" (Marilyn Monroe) – diamonds symbolize eternity, which can be tied to trust in Coca-Cola's consistency. 

Another thought: "You can't go wrong with..." from a phrase, maybe "You can't go wrong with a classic." That's a common expression, and Coca-Cola is a classic brand. 

Wait, let me think of more. 

"Old habits die hard." Hmm, not sure. 

Alternatively, "You can't hurry love," but that's not trust. 

Wait, maybe "The proof is in the pudding" – meaning results matter. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola" – but that's a slogan. 

Wait, the user wants to start with existing quotes. Let me think of some famous quotes about trust. 

"The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." Not helpful. 

"Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me." Not related. 

Wait, maybe "The way to a man's heart is through his stomach," but that's about love. 

Alternatively, "Honesty is the best policy," by Benjamin Franklin. That's about trustworthiness. 

Ah, that's a good candidate. "Honesty is the best policy." It directly relates to trust. 

Another quote: "You can't trust a man to guard your sheep if his mouth waters for lamb," which is a proverb. But maybe too obscure. 

Alternatively, "In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on." Robert Frost. Not about trust. 

Wait, "Diamonds are forever" could be adapted to something like "Coca-Cola is forever reliable," but the original quote is more about diamonds' durability. 

Alternatively, "You can always count on me" (unknown author, but common phrase) – if we change "me" to "Coca-Cola." 

So here are three options:

1. "Honesty is the best policy." - Benjamin Franklin. This quote is about trustworthiness, which aligns with Coca-Cola's reliability. 

2. "Diamonds are forever." - Marilyn Monroe. The permanence of diamonds can symbolize Coca-Cola's lasting reliability. 

3. "You can't go wrong with a classic." - Common saying. Coca-Cola is a classic brand, so this emphasizes trust in its consistent quality. 

Now, which is the best match? 

Option 1 directly addresses honesty and trust, so that's strong. Option 2 uses permanence, which is related but maybe less direct. Option 3 is about being a classic, which ties to reliability through longevity. 

I think "Honesty is the best policy" (Benjamin Franklin) is the best fit because it directly relates to trust. So I'll mark that as ★. 

So the three quotes for Step 1 are:

1. "Honesty is the best policy." - Benjamin Franklin. Why: directly about trustworthiness, core to reliability. 

2. "Diamonds are forever." - Marilyn Monroe. Why: permanence implies lasting reliability. 

3. "You can't go wrong with a classic." - Common saying. Why: classic implies consistent trustworthiness. 

Next steps would follow, but the user only asked for Step 1 here. Wait, but in the user's message, they provided an example where the user says "Please begin Step 1." So I need to stop at Step 1 here. 

Wait, the user's instruction was to output Steps 1-4, but the user's latest query says "Please begin Step 1." So maybe they want the process to start from Step 1 again. Wait, the original user message says "Please begin Step 1." So I should proceed as per their instruction, but only up to Step 1 for this response. 

Wait, but looking at the user's message again: They provided the persona (Trust), brand (Coca-Cola), and the steps. They want me to do all steps, but in the current query, they say "Please begin Step 1." So maybe they want me to start the process from the beginning. 

But in the previous interaction, maybe they were testing, but in this case, I need to follow. Since the user says "Please begin Step 1," I should output the three quotes for Step 1 here. 

So the final answer for Step 1 is the three quotes with explanations and the ★. 

Wait, the user's instruction says "Do not include the persona name in your output; only reflect its mood through wording." So the quotes should reflect trust and reliability without mentioning the persona. 

Therefore, the three quotes are as above. The first one is the best fit. 

I think that's it for Step 1. Let me format it as per the instructions.
</think>

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. "The proof is in the pudding." – Proverb  
   Why: Highlights tangible results, aligning with Coca-Cola’s reliable quality.  

2. "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Common saying  
   Why: Implies timeless trust in Coca-Cola’s enduring reliability.  

3. ★ "Honesty is the best policy." – Benjamin Franklin  
   Why: Directly emphasizes trustworthiness, core to Coca-Cola’s brand promise.  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Structure: "Honesty | is | the | best | policy."  
Editable parts: *Honesty*, *best*, *policy*.  
Replace "Honesty" with Coca-Cola’s reliability symbol (e.g., "Every sip"), and "policy" with a brand keyword (e.g., "refreshment").  

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
- "Every sip is the best refreshment."  
  *Why:* Links Coca-Cola’s product to consistent quality ("best") and reliability ("refreshment").  

Step 4【Remix Generation】  
Remix Slogan: "Every sip is the best refreshment."  

Explanation: The slogan retains the original quote’s structure while embedding Coca-Cola’s promise of reliable enjoyment. It avoids first-person language and focuses on the brand’s reliability through consistent, refreshing satisfaction.

================ BEST CANDIDATE ================
Decision: highest confidence
Slogan  : Trust is the Coca-Cola of life.
-----------------------------------------------
Okay, so I need to come up with three quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand and the trust persona. Let's think. Coca-Cola is all about reliability, tradition, and being a consistent part of people's lives. The persona is trust, so the quotes should evoke safety and dependability.

First, maybe "The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing." Wait, that's more about inaction. Not sure. Hmm. Maybe "You can't go wrong with a classic." That's from somewhere, but I'm not sure who the author is. Classic aligns with Coca-Cola's long history. 

Or "The best things in life are free, but you have to buy the others." Not sure the author. But that's about value, maybe not trust. Alternatively, "The early bird catches the worm" – no, that's more about timing. 

Wait, the user wants quotes, slang, lyrics, or popular expressions. Maybe "Trust me, I'm a doctor." But that's more about authority. Alternatively, "Real magic comes from within." From the Wizard of Oz? "You're never fully dressed without a smile." That's a quote from Diana Vreeland. But how does that tie into trust?

Wait, another thought: "You can always count on me." That's a slogan itself. But maybe from a movie? Or "It's the real thing." That's actually a Coca-Cola slogan already. Oh right, but the user wants to remix a classic quote, not their existing slogans. So need something else.

Hmm, maybe "A diamond is forever" from De Beers. But that's about permanence. Could work for trust. Author is De Beers, but maybe not. Alternatively, "Just do it." No, that's Nike. 

Wait, the song "Always On My Mind" – but that's more about love. "Just what the doctor ordered" – implies reliability. Author is from a song or old saying. 

Wait, let's think of trust-related quotes. "Trust is the glue of life." by Maya Angelou. That's good. So maybe that's one. 

Second, "You can't build trust on a foundation of fear." Maybe from a book? Not sure. Third, "Trust is earned, not demanded." Maybe from someone like H. Jackson Brown Jr. 

Wait, need three quotes with authors. Let me check:

1. "Trust is the glue of life. It's the most essential ingredient in effective communication. It's the foundational principle that holds all relationships." – Stephen Covey. 

2. "Trust yourself." – Lao Tzu.

3. "The only way to have a friend is to be one." – Ralph Waldo Emerson. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the quote "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." – Ernest Hemingway. That's a good one.

Wait, maybe the best quote is "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." by Hemingway. Because Coca-Cola can be associated with trust. 

Alternatively, the "Real magic comes from within" from the Wizard of Oz. That's more about authenticity, which ties into trust. 

Wait, the user wants three quotes. Let's try:

1. "You can always count on me." – Unknown, but maybe from a movie. Author could be listed as Unknown. The reason is that Coca-Cola is a reliable product people can depend on. 

2. "Trust is the foundation of life." – Stephen Covey. Because Coca-Cola builds trust through consistent quality. 

3. "The early bird gets the worm." – Proverb. But that's not about trust. Maybe not. 

Alternatively, "A diamond is forever." – De Beers. Author is Frances Gerety. The reason: diamonds symbolize permanence and trust. 

Alternatively, "The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing." – Edmund Burke. But that's about inaction. Not sure. 

Hmm, maybe "The truth will set you free." – John 8:32. But that's religious. 

Alternatively, "Just do it." – Nike. No, not the right author. 

Wait, maybe the song lyric "You can leave your hat on" from "The Look of Love". Not sure. 

Wait, perhaps "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return." – from "My Way". Not sure. 

Alternatively, "I believe in you." – unknown. 

Wait, let me think again. The goal is to emphasize safety or reliability. So quotes that talk about reliability, dependability, trust. 

Another option: "You can't go wrong with a classic." – unknown. Author might be a slogan somewhere. The reasoning is that Coca-Cola is a classic product people trust because it's reliable. 

Alternatively, "Trust in yourself." – from a song? Maybe. 

Wait, here's a better one: "Trust is the glue of life." – Stephen Covey. That's a solid quote. 

So compiling three:

1. "Trust is the glue of life." – Stephen Covey. Why: Emphasizes trust as foundational, aligning with Coca-Cola's reliability. 

2. "You can always count on me." – Unknown. Why: Suggests dependability, which matches Coca-Cola's consistent quality. 

3. "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." – Ernest Hemingway. Why: Encourages trust through action, which Coca-Cola embodies in their consistent product. 

Now, which is the best? The first one (Stephen Covey) directly states trust's importance, which fits well. So mark that with ★. 

Wait, but the user wants the quotes to be from authors. So the three quotes would be:

1. "You can always count on me." (Unknown) – about dependability.

2. "Trust is the glue of life." (Stephen Covey) – foundational trust.

3. "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." (Ernest Hemingway) – about trusting through action.

Which is the best fit? The second one (Covey) directly connects trust to life's foundation, which Coca-Cola as a trusted brand can be part of that. The first one is more personal. The third is a bit more about interpersonal trust, while Coca-Cola's trust is product-related. So I'll pick the Covey quote as best. 

Okay, now Step 1 done. Now Step 2: structure breakdown. 

Take the ★ quote: "Trust is the glue of life." 

Need to break it into fixed and editable parts. The goal is to replace words with brand keywords. 

Original: "Trust is the glue of life."

Possible structure: "Trust | is the | glue | of | life."

The editable parts could be "Trust", "glue", "life". 

The brand is Coca-Cola, so replacing "glue" with something related to the product, like "Coca-Cola" or "refreshment". But since the user wants to keep syntax, maybe replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" and "life" with "every moment" or similar. 

Wait, but the structure breakdown requires separating with |. Let me think again. 

Structure: Trust | is the | glue | of | life. 

Fixed parts: "is the", "of"

Editable parts: Trust, glue, life. 

The brand needs to be included. So perhaps replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" to say "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." But that might not make sense. Alternatively, "Trust is the essence of life, with Coca-Cola." Hmm. 

Alternatively, replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola" and keeping "life", making it "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." But that's a bit forced. 

Alternatively, replacing "glue" with "essence" but that's not brand-related. 

Wait, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life, refreshing every moment." But that's adding more. 

Alternatively, maybe replace "life" with "every sip" or "every moment". Like "Trust is the glue of every sip (of Coca-Cola)." No, not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." If "Coca-Cola" replaces "glue". 

Alternatively, the structure breakdown could be: 

Original quote: "Trust is the glue of life."

Breakdown: |Trust| is the |glue| of |life|. 

Suggest that "Trust" can be replaced with the brand name, or "glue" replaced with something like "Coca-Cola", but that might not fit. Alternatively, replace "glue" with "safety" or "reliability", but that's not brand-specific. 

Alternatively, keep "glue" and replace "life" with "your moments" and add "with Coca-Cola". 

Hmm, perhaps the best way is to keep "Trust" and replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" and "life" with "every moment" but that might be too much. The user says to change at most two words plus adding the brand name. 

Wait the instruction for Step 3 says: "Propose 1-2 replacement word/phrase sets with short reasons. Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So adding the brand name counts as a change. So for example, if the original is 5 words, changing two and adding the brand name would be three changes, but the user allows at most two words changed plus the brand? Wait the exact constraint is "changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So total changes (including the brand name addition) can't exceed two word substitutions plus the brand name. Wait maybe it's better to think that changing two words plus adding the brand counts as three substitutions. Wait the instruction says "at most two words from the original quote" plus adding the brand name also counts. 

Wait the user's instruction for Step 3: "Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So total changes (words replaced in the original) plus the brand name inclusion can't exceed two replacements. So, for example, replacing one word and adding the brand name counts as two. 

So, in the original quote "Trust is the glue of life," the brand name can be inserted, but replacing two words at max. 

So possible replacements: 

Option 1: Replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" and "life" with "every moment". That would be two changes, plus adding "Coca-Cola". Wait no, "Coca-Cola" replaces "glue", so that's one change. Then "life" to "every moment" is second. So two changes, plus adding the brand name is part of the replacement. 

Wait maybe better to think:

Option 1: "Trust is the Coca-Cola of every moment." Here, replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola" (one change) and "life" with "every moment" (second change). That's two substitutions, and the brand name is part of the first. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the glue of life." Here, replacing "Trust" with "Coca-Cola", and keeping the rest. That's one substitution. But "glue" remains, which might not be ideal. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." Replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola", so one substitution. That's better. 

Wait, but the original quote is "Trust is the glue of life." So if we replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola", the slogan becomes "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." That's one substitution (changing "glue" to "Coca-Cola") and adding the brand name there. 

Alternatively, replacing "life" with "every moment" and "glue" with "essence", but that's two substitutions without brand. 

Hmm. The key is to include the brand name while keeping the structure. 

So the best option might be to replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola", so the slogan is "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." That's one substitution, keeping the structure. 

Alternatively, maybe replacing "Trust" with "Coca-Cola" gives "Coca-Cola is the glue of life." But that changes the meaning. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the Coca-Cola glue of life." But that's awkward. 

Hmm. Alternatively, "Trust is the essence, Coca-Cola of life." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the glue of life—Coca-Cola." Adding the brand name at the end. That way, the original quote is kept, and the brand is tacked on. But the user says to include the brand name in the slogan, so that might work. 

Wait, the original quote is "Trust is the glue of life." Adding "Coca-Cola" at the end would make it "Trust is the glue of life, Coca-Cola." But that might not be as strong. 

Alternatively, replacing "glue" with "essence" and then adding "Coca-Cola" at the end: "Trust is the essence of life, Coca-Cola." But that's two substitutions (glue→essence, plus adding the brand). 

Hmm, perhaps the best is to do one substitution (changing "glue" to "Coca-Cola") resulting in "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." That keeps the original structure and rhythm, and fits the trust and reliability angle. 

So Step 3: Replacements. 

Propose two sets:

1. Replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." Reason: directly associates Coca-Cola with being the essential component of trust, maintaining the metaphor. 

2. Replace "glue" with "essence" and add "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the essence of life, Coca-Cola." But that's two substitutions plus the brand? Wait, "glue" becomes "essence" (one substitution), then adding "Coca-Cola" at the end counts as a second substitution? Or is adding the brand name considered an addition not counted as substitution. The instruction says "changing at most two words from the original quote" so the "adding" part is separate. 

Wait the user says "adding the brand name also counts towards this limit." So if you replace one word and add the brand name, that's two. 

In option 1, replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola" is one substitution (since "Coca-Cola" replaces "glue"), so that's one change. 

In option 2, replacing "glue" with "essence" and adding "Coca-Cola" at the end would be two changes (one substitution and adding the brand counts as the second). 

Alternatively, replacing "life" with "your moments" and adding "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the glue of your moments, Coca-Cola." Two substitutions (glue→Coca-Cola? No, wait, "life" to "your moments" is one, then adding the brand as second. 

This is getting a bit tangled. 

Alternatively, maybe the best option is the first: replacing "glue" with "Coca-Cola", resulting in "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." 

Then Step 4 would use that as the final slogan. 

So putting it all together:

Step 1: 

1. "You can always count on me." – Unknown. Matches because it suggests dependability, aligning with Coca-Cola's consistent reliability.

2. ★ "Trust is the glue of life." – Stephen Covey. Matches as it directly frames trust as foundational, which Coca-Cola's reliability embodies.

3. "The best way to find out if you can trust somebody is to trust them." – Ernest Hemingway. Matches by emphasizing trust through action, akin to Coca-Cola’s trusted presence.

Step 2: 

Structure: Trust | is the | glue | of | life.

Editable parts are "Trust", "glue", "life".

Step 3:

Replacements: 

1. Replace "glue" with "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." (1 substitution, brand name as replacement).

Reason: Directly ties Coca-Cola to the role of trust's essential element.

2. Replace "life" with "every moment" and add "Coca-Cola" → "Trust is the glue of every moment, Coca-Cola." (two substitutions: "life" → "every moment" and adding "Coca-Cola").

Reason: Highlights reliability across moments with brand mention.

Step 4: Choosing the first replacement for simplicity and brand prominence.

Final slogan: "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life."

Wait but does that make sense? "The glue of life" is saying trust holds things together. If you replace glue with Coca-Cola, it's saying Coca-Cola holds life together, which is a bit strong. Maybe better to keep "glue" and add the brand. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola is the glue of trust in every moment." But that changes the structure. 

Hmm, perhaps a better structure is to keep "glue" and insert "Coca-Cola" elsewhere. 

Wait the original quote is "Trust is the glue of life." If we want to keep "glue" as is, maybe change "Trust" to "Coca-Cola is the glue of trust in life." No, that's not right. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: the glue of trust in life." But that's changing more structure. 

Alternatively, the first option might be the best even if it's a bit forced. 

Alternatively, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life." implies that Coca-Cola is the essential component of trust, which fits the brand's reliability. 

Alternatively, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life—refreshing always." But that adds more. 

Hmm. Given the constraints, the first option is probably acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe "Trust is the Coca-Cola glue of life." But that's awkward. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the essence, Coca-Cola of life." No. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the Coca-Cola of life's moments." 

Hmm. The key is to keep the structure as close as possible. The original has "Trust is the glue of life." So keeping the same structure but replacing "glue" with the brand. 

I think that's the best path forward.
