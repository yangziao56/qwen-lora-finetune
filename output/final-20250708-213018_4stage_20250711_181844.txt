 Structure: "If you want to [action] quickly in this world, do two things – [result] and [another result]." — Ambrose Bierce: A little [tone-modifier] is always welcome when discussing [emotion].

Replaceable words: 
- [action]: succeed (linked to achieving goals)
- [result]: take your time (linked to speed or haste)

- 'make enemies' is a direct consequence of the actions, which can be relatable to the persona's goal of addressing fear.
- 'humor' lightens the tone, making the statement more approachable and less daunting.

- "replaceable part" (e.g., "The only way out of a labyrinth is through it.") should be adapted to include a more direct reference to the brand or evoke its spirit.
- "Plato's quote" should remain unchanged as it provides the foundational statement that can be built upon.
- "Brand keywords" ("refreshment," "happiness," "moments") serve to reinforce the brand's identity and values within the quote.

1. "Nerve-wracking" better captures the fear associated with creativity, emphasizing the anxiety of not living up to expectations.
2. "Fleeting" adds a sense of urgency, suggesting that opportunities to create something impactful don't last long, thus heightening the fear of missing out.
