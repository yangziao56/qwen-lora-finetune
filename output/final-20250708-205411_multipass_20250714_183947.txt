Okay, so I need to come up with three quotes that fit the persona of fear (specifically fear of missing out or urgency) for Coca-Cola. Let me think about quotes related to missing out or urgency. The first one that comes to mind is "The early bird catches the worm," which is about taking action before others. That could work because it's about urgency. The author is John Ray.

Another one might be "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas," but that's more about secrets. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, "Live every moment like it's your last" by Tupac Shakur? That's about seizing the day, which ties into not missing out. Or "The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page" by Augustine. Not exactly fear of missing out, but close.

Wait, maybe "You only live once" (YOLO) which is a popular slang. That's about seizing the moment, so it fits the urgency and FOMO. The author istridge Bird, I think? Or it's from a Drake song. Drake's "The Motto" says "You only live once, baby." So that's a good one.

Third quote... Maybe "Time waits for no one" from an unknown author. That's definitely about urgency. Let me confirm the authors.

First quote: "The early bird catches the worm" by John Ray. It's about acting quickly, so matches urgency. 

Second quote: "You only live once" by Drake. It's perfect for FOMO, encouraging to act now. 

Third quote: "Time waits for no one" by possibly Greek origin? Or maybe Socrates? Not sure, but the message is urgency. 

Now, explaining why each matches. The best one would be Drake's "YOLO" because it directly relates to not missing out. So I'll mark that as ★.

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. "You only live once." — Drake ★  
   Why: Encourages seizing the moment, directly countering fear of missing out (FOMO).  

2. "The early bird catches the worm." — John Ray  
   Why: Urgency to act before others, aligns with neutralizing FOMO.  

3. "Time waits for no one." — Anonymous  
   Why: Emphasizes fleeting opportunities, but less direct than Drake's lyric.  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Structure: You only live | once |.  
Editable parts: "once" (urgency trigger) and "live" (action verb). "You" and "only" are fixed to preserve syntax.  

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
1. "once" → "today" | "live" → "taste"  
   Why: "Taste" ties to Coca-Cola’s experience, "today" adds urgency.  

2. "once" → "now" | "live" → "savor"  
   Why: "Savor" emphasizes enjoyment, "now" amplifies immediacy.  

Step 4【Remix Generation】  
Remix Slogan: "You only savor now."  

Explanation: "Savor" connects to Coca-Cola’s consumption, while "now" reinforces urgency and FOMO resistance. The structure mirrors the original lyric’s rhythm.
