Okay, so I need to come up with a slogan for Coca-Cola using a remix of a classic quote, lyric, or phrase that matches the joy and excitement tone. Let's start with Step 1: Quote Matching. I need three options with their authors.

First, what classic phrases are associated with happiness? "The best things in life are free" by Rossini? Wait, actually I think that's from a song. Maybe "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong? "I see trees of green, red roses too" – maybe too long. The user wants 5-10 words. "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King's "Hakuna Matata, what does it mean? No worries..." Hmm, the full lyric might be too long, but maybe the shorter part. Alternatively, the chorus: "Hakuna Matata! It means no worries!" That's close to 10 words. 

Another option could be "Make every day a party" from a song or maybe a Disney movie? "Party rock anthem" but that's more recent. Or maybe a line from a popular song. Wait, "Living on a Prayer" by Bon Jovi – but that's more about struggling and having hope. 

Wait, maybe "Life is a party and I want to have fun" from a song? No, that's more 80s, maybe from "Living on a Prayer" too. Hmm. Alternatively, "The joy of living, the thrill of the fight..." but not sure. 

Wait, the classic quote "Carpe Diem" is "Seize the day", but that's Latin. Maybe the quote from Dead Poets Society? "Seize the day, make your lives extraordinary." But the user wants English quotes. 

Alternatively, "Turn up the volume" – but that's a slogan already? Not sure. Maybe "Turn up the music" from a song? 

Alternatively, "Let it go" from Frozen? "Let it go, let it go..." but that's more about letting go of fear. 

Hmm. Let me think again. The brand is Coca-Cola, and the tone is joy/excitement. Maybe a quote that's energetic and about happiness. 

"Happy together" from The Turtles' song "Happy Together". The lyric: "Happy together" is short enough. The author would be The Turtles. 

Another one: "Let's go all the way!" Maybe from a song? "Let's go all the way" is from "All Right Now" by Free? Or another song? 

Alternatively, "Give me joy" – not sure. 

Wait, "Life is a party" by some song? The song "Life Is a Party" by Jessica Simpson? Not sure if that's a classic enough. 

Hmm. Maybe "The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat" from Howard Cosell, but that's more sports. 

Wait, maybe the lyric from "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey: "Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world." Not quite. The chorus: "Don't stop believin', hold on to that feelin'..." Maybe not. 

Alternatively, the Coca-Cola song "I'd Like to Buy the World a Home" by Nilsson, but that's the actual song they used. But that's a Coca-Cola ad jingle, maybe too on the nose. 

Alternatively, "You've got a friend in me" from Toy Story, but that's more about friendship. 

Wait, "It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood" from Mr. Rogers? That's more about comfort. 

Wait, the user said "Joy" so maybe "Happiness is the best makeup" – not sure. 

Alternatively, "You light up my life" from the song by Kiki Dee? 

Wait, "Life is a party, don't you know it?" Not sure. 

Hmm. Let me think of some classic quotes. 

Maybe "The greatest happiness is to see our kindred happy." – Confucius. But that's long. 

Alternatively, "Laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human face." – Victor Hugo. Maybe too wordy. 

Alternatively, "Life is a cabaret, old chum." From Cabaret, "Life is a cabaret, so enter joyfully." 

Alternatively, the lyric "Let's dance!" by David Bowie, but that's short. 

Wait, "Living on a Prayer" by Bon Jovi has "Two hundred and seventy-three days a year" but not sure. 

Alternatively, "All you need is love" by The Beatles. The full lyric is "All you need is love", which is 4 words. Author: The Beatles. 

That's a strong candidate. 

So possible options:

1. "The best things in life are free" – by a song? The song is "The Best Things in Life Are Free" by Al Jolson? But the original lyric might be from there. 

2. "All you need is love" by The Beatles.

3. "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" from The Lion King's "Hakuna Matata" song. The actual line might be "Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase!" – so maybe "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" as the quote. The authors would be Elton John and Tim Rice, since they wrote the songs for The Lion King.

So that's three options. 

Now, why do they match?

1. "The best things in life are free" – emphasizes that happiness can come without cost, aligning with Coca-Cola's product as a treat that brings joy. 

2. "All you need is love" – love can be paired with Coca-Cola as a symbol of shared happiness. 

3. "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase" – signifies carefree joy, matching the brand's celebratory vibe.

Now, decide which is best. "Hakuna Matata" is more about no worries and joy, which fits. "All you need is love" is very strong but maybe too abstract. "Best things in life..." might imply that Coca-Cola is one of those things. 

The best match would probably be "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" since it's a phrase associated with pure joy and celebration, which Coca-Cola embodies. So mark that with a star. 

Wait but need to check the exact lyric. Let me recall. The song goes: "Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase. Hakuna Matata! Ain't no passing craze. It means no worries, for the rest of your days..." So the full line is "Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase!" – that's exactly 8 words. 

Yes, that's a good match. 

Alternatively, "All you need is love" is very concise. But maybe that's a better match because it's shorter and more well-known? But the user allows 5-10 words, so Hakuna Matata is okay. 

So step 1 done. Now step 2: structure breakdown. 

Best quote is Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase! ★

Breakdown into editable and fixed parts. Use | to separate. 

The original is "Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!" 

The words that can be replaced are "Hakuna Matata" and "wonderful". 

Because "Hakuna Matata" is the phrase being celebrated, so we can replace that with Coca-Cola's name or a keyword like "Coca-Cola" or "Coke". "Wonderful" could be replaced with "joy" or "delicious" but maybe better to keep as "wonderful" because it's the emotional link. Alternatively, "wonderful" might stay fixed, and the first part can take the brand. 

Wait, the structure breakdown requires pointing out which words can be replaced. So in the quote, "Hakuna Matata" is the key phrase they're talking about, so that's the editable part where we can put "Coca-Cola" or "Coke". The "wonderful" might also be replaceable with an adjective that matches the brand's benefit, like "sparkling", "delicious", etc. 

So structure breakdown would be: 

Structure: Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!

Replaceable parts: "Hakuna Matata" (phrase name) and "wonderful" (adjective). 

In replacements: 

Maybe replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" with "delicious" or "joyous". 

Alternatively, just replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola", keeping "wonderful".

Step 3: vocabulary replacement. 

Propose 1-2 sets. 

Option 1: "Coca-Cola | what a joyful phrase!" (but phrase doesn't fit with Coca-Cola unless it's a slogan itself. Wait, maybe "Coca-Cola" as the "phrase"? Hmm, maybe not. 

Alternatively, since the original is celebrating the phrase "Hakuna Matata", maybe in the replacement, the brand is the "phrase" or the thing being celebrated. Wait, perhaps the structure is "Brand, what a [adjective] drink!"? But that changes the structure. 

Wait the original quote is celebrating the phrase "Hakuna Matata" as a wonderful expression. So in the remix, we want to make the brand's slogan be the phrase that's wonderful. So "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" but that might not fit the brand. Alternatively, perhaps the structure should be "Coca-Cola, what a [adjective] drink!" but maybe the structure can stay as is but the "Hakuna Matata" part is replaced by the brand and a slogan they're known for. 

Alternatively, maybe it's better to replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" with "joyful" or "delicious". 

Another option: "Coca-Cola, what a perfect sip!" 

Wait, the original is "phrase", but maybe changing that to "drink". 

Hmm, perhaps the structure needs to stay with "phrase" but the first part is the brand's slogan. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, adjust the structure to fit the brand. 

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to keep the structure similar but replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and keep "wonderful". So the slogan would be "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful drink!" – but that changes the noun from "phrase" to "drink". The original is "phrase" because it's about the phrase "Hakuna Matata". 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" but that's a bit forced. 

Alternatively, changing "phrase" to "treat" or "moment". 

Wait, perhaps the original quote's key elements are the phrase being celebrated, so the remix would have the brand as the "phrase", but maybe "Coca-Cola" isn't a phrase. Alternatively, use the brand's slogan, like "Open Happiness", but that's a specific slogan. 

Hmm, maybe the structure is better to adjust slightly. Let me think again. 

Original quote: "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" 

Structure breakdown: |Hakuna Matata| |what a| |wonderful phrase!|

Replaceable parts are "Hakuna Matata" (the phrase being celebrated) and "wonderful" (adjective). 

So replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" with "joyous". 

Result: "Coca-Cola, what a joyous phrase!" – but "phrase" still doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe replace "phrase" with "treat": "Coca-Cola, what a joyous treat!" 

Wait, but the structure requires keeping the original syntax and meter. So maybe better to stick with the same structure, changing "Hakuna Matata" to the brand and "wonderful" to a related adjective. 

Alternatively, perhaps the "phrase" can stay, implying that "Coca-Cola" is the phrase that brings joy. 

Alternatively, the brand name can be followed by the adjective, like "Coca-Cola's joy, what a wonderful thing!" but that might be too wordy. 

Alternatively, just replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and keeping "wonderful phrase" as is: 

"Coca-Cola, what a wonderful phrase!" – but that's awkward because Coca-Cola is a product, not a phrase. 

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let's think of another angle. Maybe instead of "phrase", use "slogan" but that's meta. 

Wait, maybe the original quote's structure is "X, what a Y Z!" where X is the subject, Y is an adjective, and Z is a noun. 

In the remix, we want to have "Brand, what a [adjective] [drink/joy/etc.]" 

So keeping the structure: 

Structure: [Brand] | what a [adjective] [noun]!

In the original, noun was "phrase". Maybe replace "phrase" with "joy", "sip", "treat", "moment", etc. 

Alternatively, keep "phrase" but make it fit: "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" if the idea is that "Coca-Cola" is the phrase associated with joy. 

Alternatively, change "phrase" to "soda": "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful soda!" but that's straightforward but maybe not as poetic. 

Hmm, maybe the best bet is to go with replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" with "joyful", keeping "phrase" but it might be a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling treat!" – replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola", "wonderful" with "sparkling", and "phrase" with "treat". But that's changing more than two words. 

The user says "limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So, the original is 5 words: "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" (Wait, comma-separated as "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" – but split into words, it's 7 words. Wait, the user said 5-10 words, so that's okay. 

Changing "Hakuna Matata" to "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" to "joyful" – that's two changes, and the rest remains. So the slogan would be "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" 

But "phrase" still doesn't fit. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe change "phrase" to "sip" with "wonderful", so "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful sip!" – that's two changes (brand name and "sip"). 

That might work better. 

Alternatively, keeping "wonderful" and changing "phrase" to "joy": "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful joy!" but that's not quite right. 

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure can be slightly adjusted. 

Wait, the user allows adding the brand name but counts that as a word replacement. 

Original words: "Hakuna Matata", "wonderful", "phrase"

If we replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" (brand name counts as one change), and replace "phrase" with "joy" (second change), then it would be "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful joy!" 

That's two changes. 

Or "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" – replacing "Hakuna Matata" and "phrase".

Hmm. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling phrase!" – two changes. 

But "phrase" is still not ideal. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola, what a joyful moment!" – replacing "Hakuna Matata" and "phrase" (two changes). 

This might be better, implying that drinking Coca-Cola creates a joyful moment. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful drink!" 

But again, need to ensure syntax and meter match. 

The original meter: 

Ha-kun-a ma-ta-ta, what a won-der-ful phrase!

Coca-Cola, what a joy-ful drink!

That's similar in syllables. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" 

"Coca-Cola" is 3 syllables (4 if you count each word: Co-ca-Co-la?), but "Hakuna Matata" is 6 syllables. Hmm, maybe not perfect but acceptable. 

Alternatively, to preserve meter, maybe use "Coke" as the brand. 

"Coke, what a joyful sip!" – but "Coke" is the nickname, but the user might prefer "Coca-Cola". 

Hmm. Let's proceed. 

Step 3: Replacements. 

Option 1: "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" (changes "Hakuna Matata" and "wonderful" to "joyful")

Option 2: "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful sip!" (changes "Hakuna Matata" and "phrase" to "sip")

Option 3: "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling treat!" (two changes but maybe exceeding word count?)

Wait, "treat" adds another syllable. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful treat!" – "treat" is two syllables. 

Hmm. 

Probably the best is Option 2: "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful sip!" 

Because "sip" relates to drinking, and "wonderful" keeps the original's positive adjective. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful moment!" 

Either way. 

Step 4: Remix slogan. 

Pick the best replacement. Let's go with "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" 

Wait but let's check the requirements: 

- Keep original syntax and meter. 

Original: "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" 

The structure is: [Phrase name], what a [adjective] [noun]!

So in the remix, [Brand], what a [adjective] [noun]! 

So "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" fits. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!" 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, using "wonderful" and changing "phrase" to "sip": 

"Coca-Cola, what a wonderful sip!" 

That's a valid option. 

Or maybe "Coca-Cola, what a joyful drink!" 

Yes, that's another. 

I think "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" is good because "sip" connects to drinking the product. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful treat!" 

Hmm, treat implies a snack but works as a general term. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful joy!" 

Maybe that's better, keeping "wonderful" and replacing "phrase" with "joy". 

Wait, "wonderful" and "joy" both express the positive feeling. 

But "joyful" is an adjective that describes the noun. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful moment!" 

That might be better. 

Hmm. 

I think the best option is "Coca-Cola, what a joyful moment!" 

Because it keeps "moment" as a noun that can be associated with drinking Coca-Cola, and "joyful" adds the brand's excitement. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" 

Either could work. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!" 

"Sparkling" relates to the carbonation. 

Hmm, "sparkling" is good. 

So "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!" 

That's two changes (brand and "sparkling"), replacing "Hakuna Matata" and "wonderful". 

Wait, original had "wonderful", so replacing "wonderful" with "sparkling" and "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola". 

Then the phrase becomes "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!" 

That's concise, mentions the product, and uses an adjective that relates to Coca-Cola's effervescence. 

This might be the best. 

Yes, I'll go with that. 

Final Remix Slogan: "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!"
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" - The Lion King (Elton John/Tim Rice). Celebrates carefree joy, aligning with Coca-Cola's celebratory vibe. ★  
2. "All you need is love" - The Beatles. Suggests Coca-Cola as a universal symbol of shared happiness.  
3. "The best things in life are free" - Traditional (often linked to Al Jolson). Highlights joy as accessible, mirroring the drink’s affordability.  

Structure: **Hakuna Matata** | what a | wonderful phrase!  
Replaceable parts: "Hakuna Matata" (phrase) → brand name or keyword; "wonderful" (adjective) → descriptor of joy.  

Replacements:  
1. **Coca-Cola** | what a | sparkling joy! → "sparkling" ties to the drink’s fizz; "joy" mirrors "wonderful" while emphasizing the brand’s mood.  
2. **Coca-Cola** | what a | vibrant sip! → "vibrant" evokes energy, "sip" connects to drinking the product.  

Remix Slogan: "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!"

================ BEST CANDIDATE ================
Decision: highest confidence (voting disabled)
Slogan: Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!
-----------------------------------------------
Okay, so I need to come up with a slogan for Coca-Cola using a remix of a classic quote, lyric, or phrase that matches the joy and excitement tone. Let's start with Step 1: Quote Matching. I need three options with their authors.

First, what classic phrases are associated with happiness? "The best things in life are free" by Rossini? Wait, actually I think that's from a song. Maybe "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong? "I see trees of green, red roses too" – maybe too long. The user wants 5-10 words. "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King's "Hakuna Matata, what does it mean? No worries..." Hmm, the full lyric might be too long, but maybe the shorter part. Alternatively, the chorus: "Hakuna Matata! It means no worries!" That's close to 10 words. 

Another option could be "Make every day a party" from a song or maybe a Disney movie? "Party rock anthem" but that's more recent. Or maybe a line from a popular song. Wait, "Living on a Prayer" by Bon Jovi – but that's more about struggling and having hope. 

Wait, maybe "Life is a party and I want to have fun" from a song? No, that's more 80s, maybe from "Living on a Prayer" too. Hmm. Alternatively, "The joy of living, the thrill of the fight..." but not sure. 

Wait, the classic quote "Carpe Diem" is "Seize the day", but that's Latin. Maybe the quote from Dead Poets Society? "Seize the day, make your lives extraordinary." But the user wants English quotes. 

Alternatively, "Turn up the volume" – but that's a slogan already? Not sure. Maybe "Turn up the music" from a song? 

Alternatively, "Let it go" from Frozen? "Let it go, let it go..." but that's more about letting go of fear. 

Hmm. Let me think again. The brand is Coca-Cola, and the tone is joy/excitement. Maybe a quote that's energetic and about happiness. 

"Happy together" from The Turtles' song "Happy Together". The lyric: "Happy together" is short enough. The author would be The Turtles. 

Another one: "Let's go all the way!" Maybe from a song? "Let's go all the way" is from "All Right Now" by Free? Or another song? 

Alternatively, "Give me joy" – not sure. 

Wait, "Life is a party" by some song? The song "Life Is a Party" by Jessica Simpson? Not sure if that's a classic enough. 

Hmm. Maybe "The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat" from Howard Cosell, but that's more sports. 

Wait, maybe the lyric from "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey: "Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world." Not quite. The chorus: "Don't stop believin', hold on to that feelin'..." Maybe not. 

Alternatively, the Coca-Cola song "I'd Like to Buy the World a Home" by Nilsson, but that's the actual song they used. But that's a Coca-Cola ad jingle, maybe too on the nose. 

Alternatively, "You've got a friend in me" from Toy Story, but that's more about friendship. 

Wait, "It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood" from Mr. Rogers? That's more about comfort. 

Wait, the user said "Joy" so maybe "Happiness is the best makeup" – not sure. 

Alternatively, "You light up my life" from the song by Kiki Dee? 

Wait, "Life is a party, don't you know it?" Not sure. 

Hmm. Let me think of some classic quotes. 

Maybe "The greatest happiness is to see our kindred happy." – Confucius. But that's long. 

Alternatively, "Laughter is the sun that drives winter from the human face." – Victor Hugo. Maybe too wordy. 

Alternatively, "Life is a cabaret, old chum." From Cabaret, "Life is a cabaret, so enter joyfully." 

Alternatively, the lyric "Let's dance!" by David Bowie, but that's short. 

Wait, "Living on a Prayer" by Bon Jovi has "Two hundred and seventy-three days a year" but not sure. 

Alternatively, "All you need is love" by The Beatles. The full lyric is "All you need is love", which is 4 words. Author: The Beatles. 

That's a strong candidate. 

So possible options:

1. "The best things in life are free" – by a song? The song is "The Best Things in Life Are Free" by Al Jolson? But the original lyric might be from there. 

2. "All you need is love" by The Beatles.

3. "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" from The Lion King's "Hakuna Matata" song. The actual line might be "Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase!" – so maybe "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" as the quote. The authors would be Elton John and Tim Rice, since they wrote the songs for The Lion King.

So that's three options. 

Now, why do they match?

1. "The best things in life are free" – emphasizes that happiness can come without cost, aligning with Coca-Cola's product as a treat that brings joy. 

2. "All you need is love" – love can be paired with Coca-Cola as a symbol of shared happiness. 

3. "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase" – signifies carefree joy, matching the brand's celebratory vibe.

Now, decide which is best. "Hakuna Matata" is more about no worries and joy, which fits. "All you need is love" is very strong but maybe too abstract. "Best things in life..." might imply that Coca-Cola is one of those things. 

The best match would probably be "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" since it's a phrase associated with pure joy and celebration, which Coca-Cola embodies. So mark that with a star. 

Wait but need to check the exact lyric. Let me recall. The song goes: "Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase. Hakuna Matata! Ain't no passing craze. It means no worries, for the rest of your days..." So the full line is "Hakuna Matata! What a wonderful phrase!" – that's exactly 8 words. 

Yes, that's a good match. 

Alternatively, "All you need is love" is very concise. But maybe that's a better match because it's shorter and more well-known? But the user allows 5-10 words, so Hakuna Matata is okay. 

So step 1 done. Now step 2: structure breakdown. 

Best quote is Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase! ★

Breakdown into editable and fixed parts. Use | to separate. 

The original is "Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!" 

The words that can be replaced are "Hakuna Matata" and "wonderful". 

Because "Hakuna Matata" is the phrase being celebrated, so we can replace that with Coca-Cola's name or a keyword like "Coca-Cola" or "Coke". "Wonderful" could be replaced with "joy" or "delicious" but maybe better to keep as "wonderful" because it's the emotional link. Alternatively, "wonderful" might stay fixed, and the first part can take the brand. 

Wait, the structure breakdown requires pointing out which words can be replaced. So in the quote, "Hakuna Matata" is the key phrase they're talking about, so that's the editable part where we can put "Coca-Cola" or "Coke". The "wonderful" might also be replaceable with an adjective that matches the brand's benefit, like "sparkling", "delicious", etc. 

So structure breakdown would be: 

Structure: Hakuna Matata | what a wonderful phrase!

Replaceable parts: "Hakuna Matata" (phrase name) and "wonderful" (adjective). 

In replacements: 

Maybe replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" with "delicious" or "joyous". 

Alternatively, just replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola", keeping "wonderful".

Step 3: vocabulary replacement. 

Propose 1-2 sets. 

Option 1: "Coca-Cola | what a joyful phrase!" (but phrase doesn't fit with Coca-Cola unless it's a slogan itself. Wait, maybe "Coca-Cola" as the "phrase"? Hmm, maybe not. 

Alternatively, since the original is celebrating the phrase "Hakuna Matata", maybe in the replacement, the brand is the "phrase" or the thing being celebrated. Wait, perhaps the structure is "Brand, what a [adjective] drink!"? But that changes the structure. 

Wait the original quote is celebrating the phrase "Hakuna Matata" as a wonderful expression. So in the remix, we want to make the brand's slogan be the phrase that's wonderful. So "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" but that might not fit the brand. Alternatively, perhaps the structure should be "Coca-Cola, what a [adjective] drink!" but maybe the structure can stay as is but the "Hakuna Matata" part is replaced by the brand and a slogan they're known for. 

Alternatively, maybe it's better to replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" with "joyful" or "delicious". 

Another option: "Coca-Cola, what a perfect sip!" 

Wait, the original is "phrase", but maybe changing that to "drink". 

Hmm, perhaps the structure needs to stay with "phrase" but the first part is the brand's slogan. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, adjust the structure to fit the brand. 

Wait, perhaps the best approach is to keep the structure similar but replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and keep "wonderful". So the slogan would be "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful drink!" – but that changes the noun from "phrase" to "drink". The original is "phrase" because it's about the phrase "Hakuna Matata". 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" but that's a bit forced. 

Alternatively, changing "phrase" to "treat" or "moment". 

Wait, perhaps the original quote's key elements are the phrase being celebrated, so the remix would have the brand as the "phrase", but maybe "Coca-Cola" isn't a phrase. Alternatively, use the brand's slogan, like "Open Happiness", but that's a specific slogan. 

Hmm, maybe the structure is better to adjust slightly. Let me think again. 

Original quote: "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" 

Structure breakdown: |Hakuna Matata| |what a| |wonderful phrase!|

Replaceable parts are "Hakuna Matata" (the phrase being celebrated) and "wonderful" (adjective). 

So replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" with "joyous". 

Result: "Coca-Cola, what a joyous phrase!" – but "phrase" still doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, maybe replace "phrase" with "treat": "Coca-Cola, what a joyous treat!" 

Wait, but the structure requires keeping the original syntax and meter. So maybe better to stick with the same structure, changing "Hakuna Matata" to the brand and "wonderful" to a related adjective. 

Alternatively, perhaps the "phrase" can stay, implying that "Coca-Cola" is the phrase that brings joy. 

Alternatively, the brand name can be followed by the adjective, like "Coca-Cola's joy, what a wonderful thing!" but that might be too wordy. 

Alternatively, just replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and keeping "wonderful phrase" as is: 

"Coca-Cola, what a wonderful phrase!" – but that's awkward because Coca-Cola is a product, not a phrase. 

Hmm, maybe this approach isn't working. Let's think of another angle. Maybe instead of "phrase", use "slogan" but that's meta. 

Wait, maybe the original quote's structure is "X, what a Y Z!" where X is the subject, Y is an adjective, and Z is a noun. 

In the remix, we want to have "Brand, what a [adjective] [drink/joy/etc.]" 

So keeping the structure: 

Structure: [Brand] | what a [adjective] [noun]!

In the original, noun was "phrase". Maybe replace "phrase" with "joy", "sip", "treat", "moment", etc. 

Alternatively, keep "phrase" but make it fit: "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" if the idea is that "Coca-Cola" is the phrase associated with joy. 

Alternatively, change "phrase" to "soda": "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful soda!" but that's straightforward but maybe not as poetic. 

Hmm, maybe the best bet is to go with replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" with "joyful", keeping "phrase" but it might be a stretch. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling treat!" – replacing "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola", "wonderful" with "sparkling", and "phrase" with "treat". But that's changing more than two words. 

The user says "limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So, the original is 5 words: "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" (Wait, comma-separated as "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" – but split into words, it's 7 words. Wait, the user said 5-10 words, so that's okay. 

Changing "Hakuna Matata" to "Coca-Cola" and "wonderful" to "joyful" – that's two changes, and the rest remains. So the slogan would be "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" 

But "phrase" still doesn't fit. Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe change "phrase" to "sip" with "wonderful", so "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful sip!" – that's two changes (brand name and "sip"). 

That might work better. 

Alternatively, keeping "wonderful" and changing "phrase" to "joy": "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful joy!" but that's not quite right. 

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the structure can be slightly adjusted. 

Wait, the user allows adding the brand name but counts that as a word replacement. 

Original words: "Hakuna Matata", "wonderful", "phrase"

If we replace "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola" (brand name counts as one change), and replace "phrase" with "joy" (second change), then it would be "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful joy!" 

That's two changes. 

Or "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" – replacing "Hakuna Matata" and "phrase".

Hmm. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling phrase!" – two changes. 

But "phrase" is still not ideal. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola, what a joyful moment!" – replacing "Hakuna Matata" and "phrase" (two changes). 

This might be better, implying that drinking Coca-Cola creates a joyful moment. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful drink!" 

But again, need to ensure syntax and meter match. 

The original meter: 

Ha-kun-a ma-ta-ta, what a won-der-ful phrase!

Coca-Cola, what a joy-ful drink!

That's similar in syllables. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" 

"Coca-Cola" is 3 syllables (4 if you count each word: Co-ca-Co-la?), but "Hakuna Matata" is 6 syllables. Hmm, maybe not perfect but acceptable. 

Alternatively, to preserve meter, maybe use "Coke" as the brand. 

"Coke, what a joyful sip!" – but "Coke" is the nickname, but the user might prefer "Coca-Cola". 

Hmm. Let's proceed. 

Step 3: Replacements. 

Option 1: "Coca-Cola, what a joyful phrase!" (changes "Hakuna Matata" and "wonderful" to "joyful")

Option 2: "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful sip!" (changes "Hakuna Matata" and "phrase" to "sip")

Option 3: "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling treat!" (two changes but maybe exceeding word count?)

Wait, "treat" adds another syllable. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful treat!" – "treat" is two syllables. 

Hmm. 

Probably the best is Option 2: "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful sip!" 

Because "sip" relates to drinking, and "wonderful" keeps the original's positive adjective. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful moment!" 

Either way. 

Step 4: Remix slogan. 

Pick the best replacement. Let's go with "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" 

Wait but let's check the requirements: 

- Keep original syntax and meter. 

Original: "Hakuna Matata, what a wonderful phrase!" 

The structure is: [Phrase name], what a [adjective] [noun]!

So in the remix, [Brand], what a [adjective] [noun]! 

So "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" fits. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!" 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, using "wonderful" and changing "phrase" to "sip": 

"Coca-Cola, what a wonderful sip!" 

That's a valid option. 

Or maybe "Coca-Cola, what a joyful drink!" 

Yes, that's another. 

I think "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" is good because "sip" connects to drinking the product. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful treat!" 

Hmm, treat implies a snack but works as a general term. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a wonderful joy!" 

Maybe that's better, keeping "wonderful" and replacing "phrase" with "joy". 

Wait, "wonderful" and "joy" both express the positive feeling. 

But "joyful" is an adjective that describes the noun. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful moment!" 

That might be better. 

Hmm. 

I think the best option is "Coca-Cola, what a joyful moment!" 

Because it keeps "moment" as a noun that can be associated with drinking Coca-Cola, and "joyful" adds the brand's excitement. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a joyful sip!" 

Either could work. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!" 

"Sparkling" relates to the carbonation. 

Hmm, "sparkling" is good. 

So "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!" 

That's two changes (brand and "sparkling"), replacing "Hakuna Matata" and "wonderful". 

Wait, original had "wonderful", so replacing "wonderful" with "sparkling" and "Hakuna Matata" with "Coca-Cola". 

Then the phrase becomes "Coca-Cola, what a sparkling joy!" 

That's concise, mentions the product, and uses an adjective that relates to Coca-Cola's effervescence. 

This might be the best. 

Yes, I'll go with that.
