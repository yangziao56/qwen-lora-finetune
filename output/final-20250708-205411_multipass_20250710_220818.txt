--- Pass 1 (valid) ---
Okay, let me tackle this Coca-Cola slogan remix. The persona is anticipation, aiming to spark curiosity or suspense. So I need a quote that evokes waiting, expectation, or something mysterious. 

First, Step 1: Find three quotes that fit. Let's think of classic lines related to waiting or anticipation. 

1. "Something's coming, and it's gonna be enormous." from "Mean Girls". The quote has a sense of something big on the horizon, which matches anticipation and excitement. That could work for Coca-Cola's refreshing arrival.

2. "I see it. It's always been there, and it's coming." from "Interstellar". The repetition of 'coming' and the mysterious 'it' creates suspense. But maybe the space theme is too specific for a drink?

3. "I can't wait 'til we meet again." from a song lyric. It's about looking forward to a reunion, which is a positive anticipation. But maybe not as strong as the first option.

I think the first one from Mean Girls is best (★). It's catchy, youthful, and the word "enormous" can be swapped with something related to Coca-Cola's experience.

Step 2: Structure the quote. The original is "Something's coming, and it's gonna be enormous." The fixed parts are "Something's coming, and it's gonna be" and the ending. The editable word is "enormous".

Step 3: Replacements. Need to replace "enormous" with a Coca-Cola keyword. Maybe "fizzy" to reference the drink's bubbles, or "Coca-Cola". Wait, but the brand name can be added. Since the constraint allows changing up to two words, replacing "enormous" with "Coca-Cola" would work. Alternatively, "sugar-rush" or "refreshing". But "Coca-Cola" fits better to mention the brand directly.

Alternatively, "something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cold." But that changes two words. Wait, the original structure has "enormous" as the adjective. Maybe "Coca-Cola" instead of "enormous", making it "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola." Hmm, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cold." Wait, the original was "enormous", so maybe the brand attribute should be an adjective. Let me think again.

The brand goal is to spark curiosity. So maybe "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola." That ends with the brand name, which could work. Or "Something's coming, and it's gonna be bubbly." Since Coca-Cola is fizzy, "bubbly" relates to that. But "bubbly" isn't a strong keyword. Alternatively "something's coming, and it's gonna be refreshing." That's a common Coca-Cola angle. But maybe the brand name should be included.

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola." But that's a bit abrupt. Maybe "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cold." That keeps the structure, replaces "enormous" with "Coca-Cola cold" (two words changed). Let me check the constraints: changing at most two words, including adding the brand name. Since "enormous" is one word, replacing it with "Coca-Cola cold" would be two changes (the original word plus adding another). Wait, the original quote has "enormous" as one word. So replacing "enormous" with "Coca-Cola" would be one word (since it's substituting). Alternatively, "Coca-Cola cold" would be two words replacing one, so that's allowed? The instruction says "change at most two words from the original quote", so replacing one word with two is allowed as long as the total changes are two. Hmm, maybe.

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola delicious." But "delicious" is not specific. 

Wait, the best replacement might be "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cold." That keeps the structure, replaces "enormous" with "Coca-Cola cold" (two words), which adds the brand and describes it. The original "enormous" was an adjective, so replacing with an adjective and noun? Wait, "Coca-Cola cold" is noun + adjective? Maybe not. Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola's moment." Hmm, not as good. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be bubbly Coca-Cola." But that rearranges. 

Hmm. Maybe the best is to just replace "enormous" with "Coca-Cola" to keep it as an adjective? But "Coca-Cola" is a noun. Maybe "Coca-Coly" as a playful version? Not sure. Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cold." That works as a phrase, even if it's two words. The original was "enormous" so replacing with two words is okay. The structure is "something's coming, and it's gonna be [adjective phrase]." So "Coca-Cola cold" could work as a descriptor. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be fizzy." Since "fizzy" is a characteristic of Coke. But that doesn't include the brand name. The brand name is important to include. So the better option is "Coca-Cola cold" as the replacement for "enormous". 

So in Step 3, the replacement would be "Coca-Cola cold" (two words) for "enormous". 

Then, the final slogan would be "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cold." That ends with a period. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola." But that's one word change. Maybe that's simpler. Let me see. "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola." The word "enormous" is replaced with "Coca-Cola", which is a noun. But the structure requires an adjective. Hmm. Maybe the verb structure can allow that. "It's gonna be Coca-Cola" as in the thing coming is Coca-Cola. That might work. It's a bit more direct but still maintains the anticipation. 

Wait, the original quote was from Mean Girls, where "something's coming" refers to something big. Replacing "enormous" with "Coca-Cola" turns it into "the something coming is Coca-Cola", which fits the anticipation of the product. So that's a valid approach. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cold." That includes the brand and an attribute. Maybe that's better. 

I think "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cold." is better because it adds a descriptor related to the drink (cold) and the brand name. But I need to check the structure breakdown again. 

Original quote structure: "Something's coming, and it's gonna be |enormous|." So the editable part is "enormous". Replacing it with "Coca-Cola cold" (two words) is okay. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola's turn." But that might not fit. 

Hmm, maybe "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola's moment." Not as catchy. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola." That's concise and uses the brand name directly. 

Since the persona is anticipation, the slogan needs to spark curiosity. Ending with "Coca-Cola" might not be as strong as including an adjective. Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cool." 

Wait, but the brand is Coca-Cola, so the main thing is to include the name. 

I think the best is "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola cold." It keeps the structure, adds the brand and a relevant descriptor (cold), and ends with the brand. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola's turn." Hmm. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola refreshing." That's two words (Coca-Cola is part of the brand, so replacing "enormous" with "refreshing" would be one word change. Wait, "enormous" is one word, so replacing with "Coca-Cola's" would be two words, but maybe better to stick to one. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola." That's a single word replacement (replacing "enormous" with "Coca-Cola"), which is allowed. 

This might be the better option. So the final slogan would be "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola." That's concise, uses the brand name, and maintains the original structure. 

I think that works better. So I'll go with that as the final slogan.

Remix Slogan: "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola."

--- Pass 2 (valid) ---
Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants a slogan for Coca-Cola with the tone of anticipation, aiming to spark curiosity or suspense. First, I need to find three quotes that fit that mood and brand. 

Starting with quotes about anticipation. Maybe some classic lines from movies or songs. "May the Force be with you" is a strong contender. It's from Star Wars, and it's a hopeful, anticipatory message. But does it fit Coca-Cola? Maybe not directly, but the anticipation part could work if we tweak it.

Another thought: "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades." Timbuk3's song. That's definitely about looking forward, which ties into anticipation. The brightness could relate to Coca-Cola's refreshing image. 

Third option: "You can't handle the truth!" from A Few Good Men. Hmm, that's more confrontational. Not sure if that fits the brand's positive vibe. Maybe not the best. Wait, maybe another quote. "Something's coming, I can feel it in the air." From West Side Story? Or another source. That's more about a coming event, creating suspense. 

Wait, let me think again. The user said three sentences. Let me pick the top three. "May the Force..." is first. "The future's bright..." second. Maybe "The greatest glory..." but that's about living. Not sure. Alternatively, "The world is yours" from The Lego Movie? No, maybe not. 

Alternatively, "I see a bluebird in my heart, and it's named Coca-Cola" but that's a real ad, maybe not a classic quote. Need to stick to existing quotes. 

Wait, "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades" is good. Third could be "You've got to hide your love away" but that's more about secrecy. Hmm. Alternatively, "The time is now" but too generic. 

Alternatively, "We're going to see the elephant" from a song? Not sure. Maybe "Something's coming, I can feel it in the air" from West Side Story's "Something's Coming". That's a better fit. Let me confirm that lyric. Yes, from the musical. 

So three quotes:

1. "May the Force be with you" – Star Wars. It's a hopeful, anticipatory message. The force could be replaced with something related to Coca-Cola's refreshment or joy. 

2. "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades" – Timbuk3. The future being bright ties into anticipation, and the "bright" could link to Coca-Cola's vibrant branding. 

3. "Something's coming, I can feel it in the air" – West Side Story. Directly about anticipation and a sense of something new, which could be tied to Coca-Cola's next moment. 

Now, which is the best? The second one might be more catchy and easier to adapt. The third is also good, but maybe harder to fit the brand. The first is a classic quote, but the force might not connect directly. 

Marking the second as ★. 

Moving to structure breakdown. Take the second quote: "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades." 

Breaking it into fixed and editable parts. The structure would be:

"The future's so |bright|, I gotta wear |shades|."

The words "bright" and "shades" can be replaced. "Bright" could be replaced with something like "refreshing" or "sparkling", and "shades" with "a Coca-Cola" or "Coca-Cola's glow". 

But need to keep the rhythm. The original has 8 syllables in the first part, maybe. Let's check syllables:

"The future's so bright" (5 syllables), "I gotta wear shades" (5). So replacing "bright" with a similar syllable count. "Sparkling" is two syllables, so that works. "Shades" is one syllable. Maybe "a Coke" (two syllables) would disrupt the cadence. Hmm. 

Alternatively, "The future's so refreshing, I gotta taste the Coke." Wait, but that changes more words. The user says to change at most two words, including brand name. 

Wait the structure breakdown: The user says to use | to separate editable and fixed parts. So perhaps:

"The future's so |bright|, I gotta wear |shades|."

Then suggest replacing "bright" with "refreshing" and "shades" with "a Coke". But "wear a Coke" doesn't make sense. Alternatively, "The future's so refreshing, I gotta drink it all day." Not sure. 

Hmm, maybe better to change "shades" to "Coca-Cola". Let's see:

"The future's so bright, I gotta drink Coca-Cola." But that's changing two words: "bright" to "bright" stays, and "shades" to "drink Coca-Cola", but that's more than two words. Wait, the limit is changing at most two words, including the brand name. The brand name counts as a replacement. 

Alternatively, "The future's so refreshing, I gotta taste the Coke." Here, "bright" replaced with "refreshing", and "shades" replaced with "taste the Coke". That's two changes. 

Or "The future's so sparkling, I gotta grab a Coke." 

Alternatively, maybe "The future's so sweet, I gotta sip Coca-Cola." 

Hmm. The replacements need to make sense. Let's think of the vocabulary replacement step. 

Possible replacements:

Set 1: "bright" → "refreshing", "shades" → "a Coke" → "The future's so refreshing, I gotta wear a Coke." Wait, "wear a Coke" doesn't make sense. So that's bad. 

Set 2: "bright" → "sparkling", "shades" → "Coca-Cola" → "The future's so sparkling, I gotta wear Coca-Cola." Still not right. 

Alternatively, maybe replace "wear" with "enjoy" but that's changing the verb, which might be part of the fixed structure. 

Wait, perhaps the structure breakdown needs to identify which parts are fixed. The user says to separate editable and fixed with |. So maybe the structure is:

"The future's so |bright|, I gotta |wear shades|."

Then the editable parts are "bright" and "wear shades". The "wear shades" could be replaced with an action related to Coca-Cola. 

So replacing "bright" with "refreshing", and "wear shades" with "grab a Coke". Then the slogan becomes: "The future's so refreshing, I gotta grab a Coke." But that changes two words (refreshing and grab a Coke replaces wear shades). That's two changes. 

Alternatively, "The future's so sweet, I gotta sip Coca-Cola." Here, "sweet" replaces "bright", and "sip Coca-Cola" replaces "wear shades". 

Alternatively, "The future's so bright, I gotta taste the Coke." Here, only replacing "wear shades" with "taste the Coke", keeping "bright". But that's one change. 

Hmm, the user allows up to two replacements. Let's try to make two changes. 

Maybe "The future's so refreshing, I gotta drink it all day." But "refreshing" and "drink it all day" replace "bright" and "wear shades". 

Alternatively, "The future's so sparkling, I gotta grab a Coke." That's two changes. 

I think "sparkling" and "grab a Coke" works better. 

So the final slogan would be: "The future's so sparkling, I gotta grab a Coke!" 

Wait, but the user says to include the brand name. "Coke" is acceptable. 

Alternatively, using "Coca-Cola" but that might be longer. 

Alternatively, "The future's so refreshing, I gotta drink Coca-Cola." That's two words: refreshing and drink Coca-Cola. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe "The future's so sweet, I gotta sip Coca-Cola." 

I think the key is to maintain the original structure's rhythm. Let me count syllables again. Original: "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades." 

Breaking it down: "The fu-ture's so bright" (5 syllables), "I got-ta wear shades" (5). 

The replacement should keep similar syllables. 

"Sparkling" is 2 syllables, so replacing "bright" (1) with "sparkling" (2) would add a syllable. Hmm, that's a problem. 

"Bright" is one syllable, so maybe "refreshing" (3) is too long. 

Hmm, maybe "bright" stays, and "shades" becomes "Coke" (1 syllable). 

Wait, "I gotta wear a Coke" doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, "The future's so bright, I gotta taste the Coke." 

Here, "bright" stays, "wear shades" becomes "taste the Coke". That's one change. 

But the user allows up to two changes. 

Alternatively, "The future's so bright, I gotta drink it all day!" Here, "wear shades" replaced with "drink it all day", which is more words but the syllables might fit. 

Wait, "drink it all day" is 4 syllables, "wear shades" is 2. That's longer. 

Hmm, maybe another approach. 

Let's try the third quote option: "Something's coming, I can feel it in the air." 

Structure: "Something's coming, I can feel |it in the air|." 

Replace "it in the air" with "Coca-Cola's flavor" or something. 

But maybe that's not as catchy. 

Alternatively, the first quote: "May the Force be with you." 

Structure: "May the |Force| be with |you|." 

Replace "Force" with "Coca-Cola's fizz" and "you" with "all" → "May the Coca-Cola's fizz be with all." Doesn't fit well. 

Hmm, maybe the second quote is better. Let me think again. 

Perhaps "The future's so bright, I gotta drink Coca-Cola." Here, "bright" stays, and "wear shades" becomes "drink Coca-Cola". That's one change. But "gotta drink" fits the cadence. 

Original: "I gotta wear shades" (5 syllables: I-GOT-ta WEAR SHADES). 

"drink Coca-Cola" is 5 syllables: drink (1) co-ka-cola (3? "Coca-Cola" is 3 syllables: co-ka-cola. So "drink Coca-Cola" is 1+3=4? Hmm, "drink" is 1, "Coca-Cola" is 3, so total 4 syllables. 

"wear shades" is 2 (we-ar? No, "wear" is one, "shades" one, total 2). 

Hmm, the syllable count is off. Maybe that's a problem. 

Alternatively, "The future's so bright, I gotta grab a Coke." 

"grab a Coke" is 3 syllables (grab a coke). So "I gotta grab a Coke" is 5 syllables. "I GOT-ta grab a COKE" – that's 5 syllables. 

Original: "I GOT-ta WEAR SHADES" (5 syllables). So that works. 

Yes, that's better. So replacing "wear shades" with "grab a Coke" (two words changed: "grab a Coke" instead of "wear shades"). And "bright" could stay, but maybe replace "bright" with "sparkling". 

Wait, but changing two words. Let's say "bright" is replaced with "sparkling" (2 syllables), so the first part becomes "The future's so sparkling" (6 syllables?), let's see:

"The fu-ture's so spark-ling" – that's 7 syllables? Original was 5. Hmm, that's an issue. 

Maybe better to keep "bright" and just change the second part. 

"The future's so bright, I gotta grab a Coke." That's two words changed: "grab a Coke" instead of "wear shades". 

This way, the syllable count is similar. 

So the final slogan would be "The future's so bright, I gotta grab a Coke!" 

That seems to fit. Let's check constraints: no first-person, brand is mentioned, ends with punctuation. Yes. 

Alternatively, using "Coca-Cola" instead of "Coke" to be more formal. 

"The future's so bright, I gotta grab Coca-Cola!" 

That's better. 

So the vocabulary replacements would be replacing "wear shades" with "grab Coca-Cola", which is two words. 

Yes, that works. 

So putting it all together:

Step 1:

1. "May the Force be with you." — Star Wars. Matches because it's a hopeful, anticipatory message tied to a unifying energy. 

2. "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades." — Timbuk3. Matches because it conveys excitement about what's coming, aligning with Coca-Cola's vibrant, refreshing promise. ★

3. "Something's coming, I can feel it in the air." — West Side Story. Matches as it builds suspense around an impending moment of joy. 

Step 2: Structure breakdown with the second quote. 

"The future's so |bright|, I gotta |wear shades|."

Editable parts: "bright", "wear shades".

Step 3: Replacements: "bright" → "bright" (kept), "wear shades" → "grab Coca-Cola". 

Step 4: Final slogan: "The future's so bright, I gotta grab Coca-Cola!"

--- Pass 3 (valid) ---
Okay, so I need to come up with three quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand with an anticipation tone. The persona goal is to spark curiosity or suspense. Let me think of some famous quotes or lyrics that have an element of waiting or looking forward to something.

First, maybe "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" from West Side Story. That definitely has an anticipatory vibe. Why would that fit Coca-Cola? Well, it's about the excitement of something new or special happening, which Coca-Cola could tie into moments of joy or special occasions.

Next, "Can't wait to see you again" by Whitney Houston. Wait, that's more about longing to meet someone. But maybe the anticipation of meeting could be linked to Coca-Cola being part of those reunions or happy moments. But does it fit the suspense? Maybe not as much. Hmm.

Alternatively, "The best things in life are worth waiting for." That's a common saying. It suggests that waiting is part of the process, which could be used to highlight Coca-Cola as a reward or something that's worth the wait. But maybe that's too generic. 

Wait, the user said "spark curiosity or suspense". The first one about feeling something in the air is better for suspense. The Whitney one is more about longing, maybe not exactly suspense. The third one is more about patience. 

Another option: "Stay tuned, the best is yet to come." That's a common line from TV shows, like at the end of a commercial break. It definitely builds anticipation. Maybe that's better. The author might be unknown but used in media. Let me check. 

Alternatively, "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." – Nelson Mandela. No, that's perseverance, not anticipation.

Wait, maybe "Something wicked this way comes" from Shakespeare, but that's dark. Not for Coke.

Hmm. Let me go back. The first one, "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" is great for suspense. The second, maybe "Can't wait to see you again" isn't the best. Maybe another quote. Like "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades" by Timbuk3. That's more optimistic but not exactly suspenseful. 

Alternatively, "The end is just the beginning" by The Hobbit movie or something. But not sure.

Wait, the user needs three options. Let me think again. 

Third option: "We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when." From the WWII song. That's about anticipation of meeting again, which can tie to Coca-Cola as part of those moments. 

So my three quotes would be:

1. "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" – West Side Story (Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim). This creates suspense about an upcoming event, fitting Coca-Cola's role in moments of celebration.

2. "We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when" – Song lyric (Vernon Duke). Anticipation of future meetings, connecting to Coca-Cola as a shared experience.

3. "The best is yet to come" – Unknown, but used in various contexts. Suggests that the best moments are still ahead, tying to Coca-Cola as part of those future good times.

Wait, but the user wants each with author. The song lyric's author is Vernon Duke. The third one's author? Maybe from a movie. "The best is yet to come" was a line from the movie "Ocean's 11" (1960), but also used in other places. Let me confirm. 

Alternatively, the original quote might be from a play or another source. Either way, if I can't find the exact author, maybe I should pick another. 

Alternatively, "The greatest things in life are free, but you have to pay for electricity to keep your fridge cold so you can have a Coke." No, that's a joke, not a quote.

Hmm. Let me pick the three I have and explain why each fits.

First quote is definitely the best because of the suspenseful atmosphere. The second is good but more about longing. The third is okay but maybe too generic.

So step 1 would be:

1. "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" – West Side Story (Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim) ★. Creates suspense about an impending event, aligning with Coca-Cola’s role in moments of celebration and excitement.

2. "We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when" – Vernon Duke. Evokes the anticipation of future reunions, linking Coca-Cola to shared joyous occasions.

3. "The best is yet to come" – Ocean’s 11 (1960). Suggests anticipation of superior experiences ahead, positioning Coca-Cola as part of life’s rewarding moments.

Now, the best is the first one with the star.

Next step is structure breakdown. The quote is: "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air"

Breaking it into parts: Something's coming | you can feel it in the air

The editable parts would be "Something's" and "coming", maybe "air". Since Coca-Cola is the brand, perhaps replace "Something" with Coca-Cola, but need to keep the structure. The verbs and nouns. Let me think.

The structure is "X is coming | you can feel it in Y"

So X and Y can be replaced. The original has "Something" (noun) as X, "coming" (verb). But maybe "coming" can be part of the phrase. Wait, the structure is "Something's coming" as a noun phrase.

Alternatively, the key replaceable words are "Something" and "coming", but perhaps "air" can also be swapped. Since the goal is to include the brand name, maybe replace "Something" with "Coca-Cola" but need to adjust the structure. Like "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air". But that might not be as catchy. Alternatively, replace "coming" with something like "here" but that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe "The fizz is coming, you can feel it in the air". Hmm, but "fizz" is a Coke attribute. Or "The spark is coming..." but not sure.

Alternatively, replace "Something's coming" with "Coca-Cola's here", but that changes the structure. Wait, the structure is "X is coming, you can feel it in the air". So to keep the structure, X should be a noun, maybe "Coca-Cola" but then "Coca-Cola is coming" but that might not make sense unless they're announcing something new.

Alternatively, maybe keep "Something" but change "coming" to "bubbling" or "sparkling" to reference the drink, but that might not fit the verb. "Something's bubbling..." Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe replace "in the air" with "everywhere" to tie to Coca-Cola's presence. "You can feel it everywhere".

Wait, the goal is to replace up to two words. So perhaps:

Option 1: "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air." But that changes "Something's" to "Coca-Cola's", which is two words (replacing "Something" with "Coca-Cola's"). Wait, "Something's" is one word. So replacing "Something's" with "Coca-Cola's" would be two words (since "Coca-Cola" is a brand name, but in the structure it's "Coca-Cola's" as a possessive? That might not work. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is coming, you can feel it in the air." So replacing "Something's" with "Coca-Cola is" which is two words. But the original structure was "Something's coming", so changing to "Coca-Cola is coming" would fit, but that's two words replaced. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, keep "Something" and change "coming" to "sparkling" (but that's a verb? No, sparkling is an adjective. Hmm. Maybe "Something sparkling is coming, you can feel it..." That's more words. Not ideal.

Another option: "The fizz is coming, you can feel it in the air." Here, "Something" replaced with "The fizz", which references Coca-Cola's carbonation. Then "coming" stays, and "air" is still there. But does "fizz is coming" make sense? Maybe as part of a campaign for a new product?

Alternatively, "The refresh is coming, you can feel it in the air." "Refresh" is a key benefit of Coke. So replacing "Something" with "The refresh", but that's a bit forced.

Alternatively, "The moment is coming, you can feel it in the air." Then tie "moment" to Coca-Cola being part of the moment. But that doesn't mention the brand name.

Hmm. Maybe the first idea of replacing "Something's coming" with "Coca-Cola is coming" is better, even if it's a bit direct. Let me see:

Structure: Coca-Cola is coming | you can feel it in the air. But does that fit the rhythm? Let's check syllables.

Original: "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" – 10 syllables? Let me count: Som-thing's com-ing, you can feel it in the air – 11 syllables.

Coca-Cola is coming would be 6 syllables (Coca-Cola is com-ing). The rest remains the same. The total would be similar. Maybe acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe change "air" to "everywhere": "Coca-Cola is coming, you can feel it everywhere." But that's two changes (brand name and "everywhere"). That might work better because it emphasizes presence.

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is coming, you can taste it in the air." But taste vs feel.

Hmm. Let's see the replacement options:

Option 1: "Coca-Cola is coming, you can feel it in the air." (Replace "Something's coming" with "Coca-Cola is coming")

Option 2: "The buzz is coming, you can feel it in the air." (Replace "Something's" with "The buzz" and keep "coming")

But "buzz" could relate to energy or excitement, which Coca-Cola might be associated with. But that's two words replaced.

Alternatively, "The moment's coming, you can feel it in the air." But no brand name.

The problem is that the brand name needs to be included, so the first option is better even if it's two words (since "Coca-Cola is" replaces "Something's"). But "Coca-Cola is coming" sounds like they're introducing a new product? Maybe.

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air." Using possessive form, but maybe that's okay. Then "Coca-Cola's coming" instead of "Something's coming" – that's replacing one word? No, "Something's" is one word, "Coca-Cola's" is a possessive form but counts as one word replacement. Wait, but "Coca-Cola's" is the replacement for "Something's". So only one word is changed there. Then the rest remains. So that would be a good option, only changing "Something's" to "Coca-Cola's". But does that make sense? "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air." Maybe implying that the arrival of Coca-Cola brings the excitement. That could work. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's coming" as the first part, and then keep the rest. That's changing one word (replacing "Something's" with "Coca-Cola's"). That's within the limit of changing at most two words (including adding the brand name). Since "Coca-Cola's" is a single word replacing "Something's", that's one change. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, another replacement set: "The moment is here, you can taste it in the air." But that might not include the brand name.

Hmm, tricky. Let me list the options properly.

Replacements:

1. Replace "Something's" with "Coca-Cola's": "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air." (brand name included, one word replaced)

2. Replace "Something's coming" with "Coca-Cola is coming": (two words replaced: "Coca-Cola is" instead of "Something's")

3. Replace "air" with "everywhere": "Something's coming, you can feel it everywhere." Then maybe add the brand name somehow? Not sure.

Alternatively, combining: "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it everywhere." (two replacements: "Coca-Cola's" and "everywhere")

But need to ensure the brand is mentioned. The first option includes the brand name in one replacement. The second also does. 

Which is better? The first one is more direct, keeping the structure. "Coca-Cola's coming" as a possessive might be a bit odd, but perhaps acceptable in a slogan. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola is here" to make it present? But the original is about anticipation (coming), so "coming" is better for the suspense.

Hmm. Let me proceed with the first replacement option as the best.

So the final slogan would be: "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air."

Does that fit? The structure is maintained. It includes the brand name, and keeps the suspenseful feeling. The rhythm is similar to the original.

I think that works. Let me check the constraints: no first-person, which is okay. It's neutral. Ends with a period? The original ends with a period, so yes. 

Another possible variation could be changing "air" to something else, but maybe better to stick with the first idea.
</think>

Step 1:  
1. "Something’s coming, you can feel it in the air" – *West Side Story* (Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim) ★. Builds suspense about an approaching moment, aligning with Coca-Cola’s role in celebratory anticipation.  
2. "We’ll meet again, don’t know where, don’t know when" – *Vernon Duke*. Evokes curiosity about future shared joy, connecting to Coca-Cola as a unifying force.  
3. "The best is yet to come" – *Ocean’s 11* (1960). Implies anticipation of superior experiences, positioning Coca-Cola as part of life’s high points.  

Step 2:  
Structure: Coca-Cola's coming | you can feel it in the air.  
Editable parts: Replace "Something’s" with "Coca-Cola’s" (brand name ties directly to the "something" of excitement).  

Step 3:  
Replacements:  
1. "Coca-Cola’s coming" (replaces "Something’s coming" → ties the brand to the anticipated event).  
2. "you can taste it in the air" (replaces "feel it" → emphasizes Coca-Cola’s sensory appeal).  

Step 4:  
Remix Slogan: "Coca-Cola’s coming, you can feel it in the air."

Okay, let me tackle this step by step. The user wants me to create a slogan for Coca-Cola using the tone of anticipation, aiming to spark curiosity or suspense. First, I need to find three quotes that fit that mood. Let's see.

Hmm, anticipation often involves waiting, expectation, or something about to happen. Maybe "Something's coming..." That sounds suspenseful. The quote from Game of Thrones: "Winter is coming." But that's more about preparation than curiosity. Wait, maybe "Something wicked this way comes" from Macbeth? That's eerie and builds suspense. 

Another option: "Can't wait to see you." But that's more about excitement. Maybe a lyric? "Something in the way she moves" by The Strokes. That has a mysterious vibe. Or a classic line like "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return," but that's more about love. 

Wait, the user wants suspense. "Something's coming and it's going to blow your mind" – but not sure the source. Maybe a movie quote? "The force is strong with this one." Hmm. 

Alternatively, "The best is yet to come." That's hopeful but maybe fits anticipation. From the movie "The Gambler." 

Let me list three:

1. "Something's coming, and it's going to blow your mind." – Maybe from a movie or song? Not sure the exact author. But it has that anticipation and surprise element.

Wait, the user needs the author. Maybe I need to pick ones with known authors. Let me think again. 

"Something wicked this way comes" – Ray Bradbury's novel. That's a solid one. 

"The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades." Timbuk3. That's more optimistic. 

"Wait for it..." – From "The Lion King" song "Hakuna Matata." But that's more about waiting. 

Alternatively, "The greatest show on earth is coming to town" from Ringling Bros. But that's a slogan. 

Hmm. Let me go with:

1. "Something wicked this way comes" – Ray Bradbury. This creates suspense and anticipation of something unexpected, which aligns with sparking curiosity. 

2. "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades" – Timbuk3. It suggests something exciting is coming, which matches the anticipation but maybe not suspense. 

3. "Can't wait to see you" – SZA. More personal, but maybe the "can't wait" aspect fits anticipation. 

Wait, the third one is from SZA's song "Good Days". 

Now, why do these fit? 

First quote (Bradbury) – the mood is ominous but also anticipatory, which can spark curiosity. 

Second (Timbuk3) – the future being bright is positive anticipation but not suspenseful. 

Third (SZA) – personal and eager, but maybe less suspense. 

The best match would be Bradbury's quote, so mark it with ★.

Okay, moving on to structure breakdown. The best quote is "Something wicked this way comes." Let me separate the editable parts. 

Original: "Something wicked this way comes." 

Fixed parts could be "this way comes" and "wicked"? Wait, maybe "something [adjective] this way comes." So the editable parts are "something" and "wicked". 

Alternatively, structure as "Something | wicked | this way comes." So "something" and "wicked" can be replaced. The brand is Coca-Cola, so maybe replace "wicked" with a positive adjective, and "something" with a Coke-related noun. 

But need to keep the rhythm. The original is 8 syllables. Let me check: "Some-thing wicked this way comes" – that's 8 syllables. 

Possible replacements: 

1. "Coca-Cola" in place of "something"? But "Coca-Cola" is longer. Hmm. 

Alternatively, "Something cool this way comes." "Cool" instead of "wicked". But "cool" is 1 syllable vs "wicked" 2. 

Wait, the original has "something wicked" (3 syllables) and "this way comes" (4). So replacing "wicked" with a two-syllable word. 

Maybe "sparkling" for Coca-Cola. So "Something sparkling this way comes." 

Alternatively, "Something refreshing..." 

Alternatively, change "something" to "Coke" but "Coke wicked" doesn't make sense. 

Wait, maybe "Something fizzy..." 

Alternatively, keep "something" but change "wicked" to a Coke-related adjective. "Something sweet this way comes." 

Or "Something new..." but "new" is one syllable. 

Hmm. The replacements need to fit the meter. 

Original structure: 

Something (2) | wicked (2) | this way comes (4). Total 8. 

If replacing "something" with "Coca-Cola" (3 syllables) and "wicked" with "sparkling" (2), total becomes 3+2+4 = 9. That's too much. 

Alternatively, replace "something" with "The Coke" (2 syllables), so "The Coke sparkling this way comes" – but that's changing two words. 

Wait, the user said to replace at most two words. Let me try:

Option 1: "Something sparkling this way comes." (replaced "wicked" with "sparkling") – keeps syllables: 2+2+4. 

Option 2: "Coca-Cola's here this way comes." No, that's awkward. 

Hmm, perhaps "Coca-Cola sparkling this way comes." But "Coca-Cola" is 4 syllables, so that's 4 + 2 +4 = 10. Not good. 

Alternatively, shorten to "Coke" (1 syllable) and "sparkling": "Coke sparkling this way comes." But that's 1 +2 +4 =7. 

Hmm, tricky. Maybe "Something cool this way comes." "Cool" is 1 syllable, so 2+1+4=7. 

Alternatively, "Something refreshing..." but "refreshing" is too long. 

Wait, maybe change "something" to "A Coke" (2 syllables) and "wicked" to "sparkling" (2). "A Coke sparkling this way comes." That's 2+2+4=8. That works. 

So replacements: 

"A Coke" instead of "Something" and "sparkling" instead of "wicked". 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola" might not fit. Maybe just "Coke" for brevity. 

So the slogan would be "A Coke sparkling this way comes." But "A Coke" vs the brand name. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's sparkle this way comes." Hmm. 

Alternatively, keeping "something" and changing "wicked" to "Coca-Cola" but that doesn't fit. 

Hmm, maybe better to keep "something" and replace "wicked" with "Coca-Cola". Wait, "Something Coca-Cola this way comes" – that's 3 +3 +4? No. 

Alternatively, "Something's coming, Coca-Cola's here." Not same structure. 

Hmm, perhaps the best is to keep "something" and replace "wicked" with "sparkling", leading to "Something sparkling this way comes." Then add the brand name at the end? 

Wait the user says to include brand name or keyword, so maybe: 

"Something sparkling, Coca-Cola's here." But that's changing more words. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's coming this way." Not as poetic. 

Hmm, perhaps the best is to go with "Something sparkling this way comes." and then add "Coca-Cola" at the end? Like "Something sparkling this way comes: Coca-Cola." But the user says to include the brand name in the slogan, not as a tagline. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's coming this way, something sparkling." Not sure. 

Wait, maybe the structure breakdown allows for replacing two words. Let me think again. 

Original quote: "Something wicked this way comes."

Break it into parts where the brand can fit. Maybe "Something [adjective] this way comes." 

Replace "adjective" with "Coca-Cola" but that's a noun. Hmm. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's magic this way comes." Magic fits the anticipation. "Coca-Cola's magic" (4 syllables) instead of "something wicked" (4 syllables). 

So: "Coca-Cola's magic this way comes." That's 8 syllables. 

Yes! That works. Replacing "something wicked" with "Coca-Cola's magic". 

So the structure is: [Something] | [wicked] | this way comes. 

The brand can replace both "something" and "wicked" as a combined phrase. 

Alternatively, the structure breakdown:

Original: "Something | wicked | this way comes." 

Editable parts: "Something" and "wicked". 

Possible replacement sets: 

1. "Coca-Cola's magic" replacing "something wicked" (so two words changed: "something" and "wicked"). 

2. "Sparkling" replacing "wicked", keeping "something". 

So the first option gives "Coca-Cola's magic this way comes." 

That sounds good. 

Another option could be "The fizz" instead of "something wicked": "The fizz this way comes." But maybe less brand-specific. 

So the best replacement set is "Coca-Cola's magic" for "something wicked". 

Therefore, the final slogan would be "Coca-Cola's magic this way comes." 

That fits the structure, includes the brand, and maintains the meter. Also avoids first person. 

Let me check the constraints: 

- No first-person words. 

- Neutral perspective. 

- Ends with punctuation. 

Yes. 

So that should work.

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. "Something wicked this way comes" — Ray Bradbury. Suspenseful and mysterious, creating anticipation through an unknown "something." ★  
2. "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades" — Timbuk3. Optimistic anticipation but lacks suspense.  
3. "Can’t wait to see you" — SZA. Personal and eager but less universally suspenseful.  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Structure: "Something | wicked | this way comes."  
Editable parts: "Something" and "wicked" (both can be replaced to align with Coca-Cola’s brand).

--- Pass 5 (valid) ---
Okay, I need to come up with three quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand with an anticipation tone. Let's see. The persona goal is to spark curiosity or suspense. So the quotes should hint at something exciting coming soon, maybe something that makes you wait eagerly.

First thought: "Something's coming, and it's gonna be huge." That's from The Matrix. It has that suspenseful vibe, like anticipation of a big event. That could work for Coca-Cola, maybe hinting at a new product or campaign.

Another option: "The wait is almost over." This is from Mission: Impossible III. It's about the end of waiting, building up to a climax. Coca-Cola could use that to tease an upcoming release.

Third quote: "Bigger, better, and coming soon." This is a common slogan phrase, but maybe from a movie or product launch. It emphasizes improvement and anticipation of something new. 

Now, which is the best? The first one, The Matrix quote, has more urgency and a mysterious element. The second is also good but more about the end of waiting. The third is a bit generic. I'll mark the first one with a star.

Next, structure breakdown. The quote is "Something's coming, and it's gonna be huge ★". Split into editable parts. Maybe "Something's coming, and it's gonna be [adjective]." The "huge" can be replaced with a Coca-Cola related word. Also "coming" might be changed, but maybe keep that as fixed.

Replacement words: Instead of "huge", maybe "delicious" or "refreshing" but those are too direct. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola" could replace "huge", but need to fit the structure. Wait, the structure requires replacing words. Let me think again. The original structure is "Something's coming, and it's gonna be [adjective]."

Possible replacements: "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coke!" But that might not fit the anticipation. Or "Something's coming, and it's gonna be sweet!" Hmm, but "sweet" is more about taste. Maybe "Something's coming, and it's gonna be cool!" But "cool" is vague. Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be refreshing!" That's better. Or "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola's!" but that might not flow well. Wait, need to keep it concise. Alternatively, replace "huge" with "Coca-Cola" but that might not make sense. Maybe "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coke-red!" referencing their color. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe "Something's coming, and it's gonna be perfect!" but that's too generic. Wait, the brand needs to be mentioned. Maybe "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola!" but that changes the sentence structure. Let me check again. The original quote is "Something's coming, and it's gonna be huge." So replacing "huge" with "Coca-Cola" would be "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola!" That could work, but does it make sense? It's a bit abrupt, but maybe as a slogan. Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be the Coke way!" Not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe changing "Something's" to "Coca-Cola's"? Like "Coca-Cola's coming, and it's gonna be huge!" But that removes the mystery. The original quote's mystery is part of the anticipation. Maybe better to keep "Something's" and replace "huge" with a keyword. Let's try "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coca-Cola's!" No, that's awkward. Maybe "Something's coming, and it's gonna be Coke-red!" Still not great. Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be the real thing!" since that's their classic slogan. That might work. "The real thing" is part of their identity, so that's a good keyword. Let me see: "Something's coming, and it's gonna be the real thing!" That keeps the structure, replaces "huge" with "the real thing", and ties to Coca-Cola. That's a solid replacement.

Alternatively, "Something's coming, and it's gonna be refreshing!" which is another key attribute. So two options:

Set 1: Replace "huge" with "the real thing!" (Coca-Cola's slogan tie-in).

Set 2: Replace "huge" with "refreshing!" (brand attribute).

I think the first one is better because it references their classic slogan, adding nostalgia and recognition.

So the final slogan would be "Something's coming, and it's gonna be the real thing!" That ends with an exclamation, keeps the original structure, and includes a key brand phrase.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "Something's coming, and it's gonna be huge" ★ (The Matrix) - Mysterious anticipation with escalating excitement, aligning with Coca-Cola’s playful and iconic presence.  
2. "The wait is almost over" (Mission: Impossible III) - Builds suspense around a delayed reveal, fitting Coca-Cola’s seasonal launches.  
3. "Bigger, better, and coming soon" (General slogan trope) - Directly hints at future offerings, matching brand innovation.  

Structure:  
Something's coming | and it's gonna be | huge  
Editable: "huge" (replace with brand-linked adjective/noun); "Something's" (optional, but risky to lose mystery).  

Replacements:  
1. "the real thing" (Coca-Cola’s classic slogan, reinforces authenticity)  
2. "Coca-Cola-red" (ties color to brand identity while retaining "huge’s" scale).  

Remix Slogan: "Something's coming, and it's gonna be the real thing!"

Slogan  : Coca-Cola’s coming, you can feel it in the air.
-----------------------------------------------
Okay, so I need to come up with three quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand with an anticipation tone. The persona goal is to spark curiosity or suspense. Let me think of some famous quotes or lyrics that have an element of waiting or looking forward to something.

First, maybe "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" from West Side Story. That definitely has an anticipatory vibe. Why would that fit Coca-Cola? Well, it's about the excitement of something new or special happening, which Coca-Cola could tie into moments of joy or special occasions.

Next, "Can't wait to see you again" by Whitney Houston. Wait, that's more about longing to meet someone. But maybe the anticipation of meeting could be linked to Coca-Cola being part of those reunions or happy moments. But does it fit the suspense? Maybe not as much. Hmm.

Alternatively, "The best things in life are worth waiting for." That's a common saying. It suggests that waiting is part of the process, which could be used to highlight Coca-Cola as a reward or something that's worth the wait. But maybe that's too generic. 

Wait, the user said "spark curiosity or suspense". The first one about feeling something in the air is better for suspense. The Whitney one is more about longing, maybe not exactly suspense. The third one is more about patience. 

Another option: "Stay tuned, the best is yet to come." That's a common line from TV shows, like at the end of a commercial break. It definitely builds anticipation. Maybe that's better. The author might be unknown but used in media. Let me check. 

Alternatively, "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." – Nelson Mandela. No, that's perseverance, not anticipation.

Wait, maybe "Something wicked this way comes" from Shakespeare, but that's dark. Not for Coke.

Hmm. Let me go back. The first one, "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" is great for suspense. The second, maybe "Can't wait to see you again" isn't the best. Maybe another quote. Like "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades" by Timbuk3. That's more optimistic but not exactly suspenseful. 

Alternatively, "The end is just the beginning" by The Hobbit movie or something. But not sure.

Wait, the user needs three options. Let me think again. 

Third option: "We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when." From the WWII song. That's about anticipation of meeting again, which can tie to Coca-Cola as part of those moments. 

So my three quotes would be:

1. "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" – West Side Story (Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim). This creates suspense about an upcoming event, fitting Coca-Cola's role in moments of celebration.

2. "We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when" – Song lyric (Vernon Duke). Anticipation of future meetings, connecting to Coca-Cola as a shared experience.

3. "The best is yet to come" – Unknown, but used in various contexts. Suggests that the best moments are still ahead, tying to Coca-Cola as part of those future good times.

Wait, but the user wants each with author. The song lyric's author is Vernon Duke. The third one's author? Maybe from a movie. "The best is yet to come" was a line from the movie "Ocean's 11" (1960), but also used in other places. Let me confirm. 

Alternatively, the original quote might be from a play or another source. Either way, if I can't find the exact author, maybe I should pick another. 

Alternatively, "The greatest things in life are free, but you have to pay for electricity to keep your fridge cold so you can have a Coke." No, that's a joke, not a quote.

Hmm. Let me pick the three I have and explain why each fits.

First quote is definitely the best because of the suspenseful atmosphere. The second is good but more about longing. The third is okay but maybe too generic.

So step 1 would be:

1. "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" – West Side Story (Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim) ★. Creates suspense about an impending event, aligning with Coca-Cola’s role in moments of celebration and excitement.

2. "We'll meet again, don't know where, don't know when" – Vernon Duke. Evokes the anticipation of future reunions, linking Coca-Cola to shared joyous occasions.

3. "The best is yet to come" – Ocean’s 11 (1960). Suggests anticipation of superior experiences ahead, positioning Coca-Cola as part of life’s rewarding moments.

Now, the best is the first one with the star.

Next step is structure breakdown. The quote is: "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air"

Breaking it into parts: Something's coming | you can feel it in the air

The editable parts would be "Something's" and "coming", maybe "air". Since Coca-Cola is the brand, perhaps replace "Something" with Coca-Cola, but need to keep the structure. The verbs and nouns. Let me think.

The structure is "X is coming | you can feel it in Y"

So X and Y can be replaced. The original has "Something" (noun) as X, "coming" (verb). But maybe "coming" can be part of the phrase. Wait, the structure is "Something's coming" as a noun phrase.

Alternatively, the key replaceable words are "Something" and "coming", but perhaps "air" can also be swapped. Since the goal is to include the brand name, maybe replace "Something" with "Coca-Cola" but need to adjust the structure. Like "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air". But that might not be as catchy. Alternatively, replace "coming" with something like "here" but that might not fit.

Alternatively, maybe "The fizz is coming, you can feel it in the air". Hmm, but "fizz" is a Coke attribute. Or "The spark is coming..." but not sure.

Alternatively, replace "Something's coming" with "Coca-Cola's here", but that changes the structure. Wait, the structure is "X is coming, you can feel it in the air". So to keep the structure, X should be a noun, maybe "Coca-Cola" but then "Coca-Cola is coming" but that might not make sense unless they're announcing something new.

Alternatively, maybe keep "Something" but change "coming" to "bubbling" or "sparkling" to reference the drink, but that might not fit the verb. "Something's bubbling..." Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe replace "in the air" with "everywhere" to tie to Coca-Cola's presence. "You can feel it everywhere".

Wait, the goal is to replace up to two words. So perhaps:

Option 1: "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air." But that changes "Something's" to "Coca-Cola's", which is two words (replacing "Something" with "Coca-Cola's"). Wait, "Something's" is one word. So replacing "Something's" with "Coca-Cola's" would be two words (since "Coca-Cola" is a brand name, but in the structure it's "Coca-Cola's" as a possessive? That might not work. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is coming, you can feel it in the air." So replacing "Something's" with "Coca-Cola is" which is two words. But the original structure was "Something's coming", so changing to "Coca-Cola is coming" would fit, but that's two words replaced. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, keep "Something" and change "coming" to "sparkling" (but that's a verb? No, sparkling is an adjective. Hmm. Maybe "Something sparkling is coming, you can feel it..." That's more words. Not ideal.

Another option: "The fizz is coming, you can feel it in the air." Here, "Something" replaced with "The fizz", which references Coca-Cola's carbonation. Then "coming" stays, and "air" is still there. But does "fizz is coming" make sense? Maybe as part of a campaign for a new product?

Alternatively, "The refresh is coming, you can feel it in the air." "Refresh" is a key benefit of Coke. So replacing "Something" with "The refresh", but that's a bit forced.

Alternatively, "The moment is coming, you can feel it in the air." Then tie "moment" to Coca-Cola being part of the moment. But that doesn't mention the brand name.

Hmm. Maybe the first idea of replacing "Something's coming" with "Coca-Cola is coming" is better, even if it's a bit direct. Let me see:

Structure: Coca-Cola is coming | you can feel it in the air. But does that fit the rhythm? Let's check syllables.

Original: "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" – 10 syllables? Let me count: Som-thing's com-ing, you can feel it in the air – 11 syllables.

Coca-Cola is coming would be 6 syllables (Coca-Cola is com-ing). The rest remains the same. The total would be similar. Maybe acceptable.

Alternatively, maybe change "air" to "everywhere": "Coca-Cola is coming, you can feel it everywhere." But that's two changes (brand name and "everywhere"). That might work better because it emphasizes presence.

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is coming, you can taste it in the air." But taste vs feel.

Hmm. Let's see the replacement options:

Option 1: "Coca-Cola is coming, you can feel it in the air." (Replace "Something's coming" with "Coca-Cola is coming")

Option 2: "The buzz is coming, you can feel it in the air." (Replace "Something's" with "The buzz" and keep "coming")

But "buzz" could relate to energy or excitement, which Coca-Cola might be associated with. But that's two words replaced.

Alternatively, "The moment's coming, you can feel it in the air." But no brand name.

The problem is that the brand name needs to be included, so the first option is better even if it's two words (since "Coca-Cola is" replaces "Something's"). But "Coca-Cola is coming" sounds like they're introducing a new product? Maybe.

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air." Using possessive form, but maybe that's okay. Then "Coca-Cola's coming" instead of "Something's coming" – that's replacing one word? No, "Something's" is one word, "Coca-Cola's" is a possessive form but counts as one word replacement. Wait, but "Coca-Cola's" is the replacement for "Something's". So only one word is changed there. Then the rest remains. So that would be a good option, only changing "Something's" to "Coca-Cola's". But does that make sense? "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air." Maybe implying that the arrival of Coca-Cola brings the excitement. That could work. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's coming" as the first part, and then keep the rest. That's changing one word (replacing "Something's" with "Coca-Cola's"). That's within the limit of changing at most two words (including adding the brand name). Since "Coca-Cola's" is a single word replacing "Something's", that's one change. So that's acceptable.

Alternatively, another replacement set: "The moment is here, you can taste it in the air." But that might not include the brand name.

Hmm, tricky. Let me list the options properly.

Replacements:

1. Replace "Something's" with "Coca-Cola's": "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air." (brand name included, one word replaced)

2. Replace "Something's coming" with "Coca-Cola is coming": (two words replaced: "Coca-Cola is" instead of "Something's")

3. Replace "air" with "everywhere": "Something's coming, you can feel it everywhere." Then maybe add the brand name somehow? Not sure.

Alternatively, combining: "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it everywhere." (two replacements: "Coca-Cola's" and "everywhere")

But need to ensure the brand is mentioned. The first option includes the brand name in one replacement. The second also does. 

Which is better? The first one is more direct, keeping the structure. "Coca-Cola's coming" as a possessive might be a bit odd, but perhaps acceptable in a slogan. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola is here" to make it present? But the original is about anticipation (coming), so "coming" is better for the suspense.

Hmm. Let me proceed with the first replacement option as the best.

So the final slogan would be: "Coca-Cola's coming, you can feel it in the air."

Does that fit? The structure is maintained. It includes the brand name, and keeps the suspenseful feeling. The rhythm is similar to the original.

I think that works. Let me check the constraints: no first-person, which is okay. It's neutral. Ends with a period? The original ends with a period, so yes. 

Another possible variation could be changing "air" to something else, but maybe better to stick with the first idea.

Step 1:  
1. "Something’s coming, you can feel it in the air" – *West Side Story* (Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim) ★. Builds suspense about an approaching moment, aligning with Coca-Cola’s role in celebratory anticipation.  
2. "We’ll meet again, don’t know where, don’t know when" – *Vernon Duke*. Evokes curiosity about future shared joy, connecting to Coca-Cola as a unifying force.  
3. "The best is yet to come" – *Ocean’s 11* (1960). Implies anticipation of superior experiences, positioning Coca-Cola as part of life’s high points.  

Step 2:  
Structure: Coca-Cola's coming | you can feel it in the air.  
Editable parts: Replace "Something’s" with "Coca-Cola’s" (brand name ties directly to the "something" of excitement).  

Step 3:  
Replacements:  
1. "Coca-Cola’s coming" (replaces "Something’s coming" → ties the brand to the anticipated event).  
2. "you can taste it in the air" (replaces "feel it" → emphasizes Coca-Cola’s sensory appeal).  

Step 4:  
Remix Slogan: "Coca-Cola’s coming, you can feel it in the air."
