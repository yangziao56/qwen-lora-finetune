Okay, so I need to come up with three classic quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand and the joy persona. Let's think about quotes related to happiness, excitement, and maybe something timeless.

First, maybe "Life is a party, so let it be." That's by someone, maybe a song? Wait, that sounds like it's from the 80s or something. Hmm, actually, "Let it be" is a Beatles song, but that's not exactly the same. Maybe "Life is a party, and I've got a ticket" – no, not sure. Alternatively, "Party like it's 1999" by Prince? That's more about a specific time. 

Another thought: "The best things in life are free, but you can't beat the price." Wait, no, that's a commercial line. Maybe "Make every day a party" – but that's a slogan itself. Maybe "Laughter is the best medicine" by someone, but that's more about health. 

Wait, the user wants classic quotes, slang, lyrics, or popular expressions. Let me think of lyrics. "Living on a prayer" by Bon Jovi? Not exactly. "Don't stop believin'" by Journey. "I got you under my skin" by someone else? 

Wait, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return" – that's Whitney Houston. But maybe not for Coca-Cola. 

Alternatively, "Just do it" is Nike, but that's a slogan. Hmm.

Maybe "What's up, Doc?" from Bugs Bunny – that's a classic line and conveys joy. But maybe too specific. "Life is a cabaret, old chum" from Cabaret. That's more about living life to the fullest, which fits Coca-Cola's "Open Happiness" campaign. 

Wait, here's a better one: "Make every day a celebration." That's a slogan, but maybe the original quote is "Celebrate every moment" or something. 

Alternatively, "Here's to the crazy ones" – that's Apple's Think Different campaign. Not exactly. 

Wait, maybe "Keep calm and carry on" – but that's British WWII slogan, more about resilience. 

Hmm. Let me think of lyrics. "I wanna dance with somebody" by Whitney Houston. The line "I like to party" by someone? 

Wait, here's a possible one from a song: "Living la vida loca" by Ricky Martin. "La vida loca" means crazy life, but that's in Spanish. 

Wait, "The way I see it, life is a cabaret" from Cabaret's song. The full line is "The way I see it, life is a cabaret, old chum, so come with me." Maybe shortening to "Life is a cabaret, so come with me" but that's more than 10 words. 

Alternatively, "Life is a party, so let it be" – I think that's a song by The Hooters? "All you zombies" song. The line "Life is a party and I've got a ticket" is from that song. So maybe "Life is a party, so let it be" as the quote. 

Another option: "What a feeling!" from the Rocky movies. That's short and conveys excitement. 

Third idea: "Let's have a good time" – that's a common expression, but maybe not a specific quote. 

Wait, maybe "Just call me... a friend of the Earth" from the Friends theme song? No, that's not right. 

Alternatively, "Always look on the bright side of life" from Monty Python's "The Life of Brian". The full quote is "Always look on the bright side of life, always look on the bright side of life..." That's a good quote for joy. 

So compiling three quotes:

1. "Life is a party, so let it be." - The Hooters. Matches because it's about living joyfully, which Coca-Cola's ads often do.
2. "What a feeling!" - Sylvester Stallone (Rocky). Matches excitement and exhilaration.
3. "Always look on the bright side of life." - Monty Python. Encourages positivity, aligning with Coca-Cola's uplifting vibe.

Mark the best as the first one, since it's directly about a party, which Coca-Cola often ties to celebrations.
