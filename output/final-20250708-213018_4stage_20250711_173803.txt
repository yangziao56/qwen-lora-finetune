Reasons: 
1. "Refreshing" replaces "greatness" as a more relatable and aspirational concept that aligns with Coca-Cola's image of bringing joy and refreshment. It also connects with the brand's promise of providing a refreshing experience.
2. "Exclusive" replaces "happiness" as it suggests a sense of uniqueness and personal fulfillment, which can be associated with special achievements or moments. This term also subtly promotes Coca-Cola as a choice for celebrating such occasions.

Quote:
6. "There's nothing to being great - find something you love doing and figure out how to get paid to do it." — Tony Robbins: When people see your work ethic and dedication they’ll respect you even though they might not understand why this matters so much to you personally.

Breakdown:
Structure: "There's nothing to being [refreshment] - find something you love doing and figure out how to make it [happiness]. When people taste your [moments] and dedication, they'll admire you, even if they don't grasp the [importance] to you personally."

Candidate replacements:
Replacements: "There's nothing to being [refreshing] - find something you love doing and figure out how to make it [exclusive]. When people savor your [moments] and dedication, they'll respect you, even if they don't fully comprehend the [value] to you personally."

Reasons: 
1. "Refreshing" replaces "greatness" as a more relatable and aspirational concept that aligns with Coca-Cola's image of bringing joy and refreshment. It also connects with the brand's promise of providing a refreshing experience.
2. "Exclusive" replaces "happiness" as it suggests a sense of uniqueness and personal fulfillment, which can be associated with special achievements or moments. This term also subtly promotes Coca-Cola as a choice for celebrating such occasions.

I am the essence of refreshment, happiness in every moment, commemorating accomplishment and uniqueness.

The greatest refreshment in living lies not in avoiding falls, but in celebrating every rise.

Remix Slogan: "If a man cannot appreciate his achievements clearly, he has no right to consider himself deserving of high praise."

Don't let anyone undermine your accomplishments!

Remix Slogan: "When I savor refreshment and my life experiences, I realize that I feel happiness in proportion as I live by faith rather than by doubt."

There's nothing to being refreshing - find something you love doing and figure out how to make it exclusive. When people savor your moments and dedication, they'll respect you, even if they don't fully comprehend the value to you personally.

Explanation: Changed “successes” to “triumphs” to add a sense of grandeur and celebration and replaced “happiness” with “moments” to emphasize shared experiences.
