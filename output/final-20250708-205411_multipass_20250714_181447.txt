Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants a slogan for Coca-Cola with the tone of anticipation and the goal to spark curiosity or suspense. 

Starting with Step 1: Quote Matching. I need to find three quotes that fit the mood of anticipation. Let's think of famous lines that create suspense or curiosity.

First quote idea: "Something's coming, and it's coming soon." That feels like it's building suspense, which matches the anticipation. But maybe that's too generic. 

Wait, maybe a song lyric? "Don't stop till you get enough" by Michael Jackson? Hmm, that's more about persistence. Not sure if it fits anticipation. 

How about "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades"? Tim McGraw. That's about something exciting to come, which could work. It's got a hopeful, expecting something big vibe. 

Another option: "You can't always get what you want" by Rolling Stones. That's more about unfulfilled desires, not exactly anticipation. 

Wait, maybe a movie quote? "May the Force be with you." Star Wars. But that's more of a farewell. 

Hmm, maybe the opening of "Breaking Bad": "Say my name." Not sure. 

Wait, there's a lyric from "Hotel California": "You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave." That's mysterious but maybe too dark. 

Alternatively, "I see it. I can't explain it. But something's happening." From Stranger Things? Not sure the source. 

Wait, the quote "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" from West Side Story? That's a musical, and the line is about impending tension or change, which fits anticipation. 

Third idea: "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return." From Beatles' "The Long and Winding Road." Not sure that's suspenseful. 

Wait, "The adventure of a lifetime awaits" from Pirates of the Caribbean? That's more about an adventure, which can create anticipation. 

Okay, let me list three. 

First: "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades" – Tim McGraw. It's about an exciting future, which creates anticipation. 

Second: "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air" – West Side Story. Definitely about anticipation. 

Third: "The greatest thrill in life is anticipation." – Dorothy Parker. But that's more about the feeling itself, not necessarily sparking it. 

Wait, maybe "Something wicked this way comes" from Shakespeare's Macbeth. But that's ominous. 

Alternatively, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return" – too soft. 

Hmm. Let me finalize the three quotes. 

1. "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades." – Tim McGraw. Matches because it suggests an exciting, awaited future (anticipation). 

2. "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air." – West Side Story. Perfectly fits anticipation and suspense. 

3. "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return." – The Beatles. Maybe not the best for suspense, but anticipation of love. 

Wait, maybe another quote. "Stay tuned, because something big is coming." Not a classic. 

Alternatively, "You can't rush perfection." Not exactly. 

Alternatively, "The best is yet to come." – Frank Sinatra. That's a classic. It suggests that what's coming is the best, which creates anticipation. 

Ah, that's better. So let's adjust. 

First quote: "The best is yet to come." – Frank Sinatra. 

Second: "The future's so bright..." 

Third: "Something's coming..." 

Okay, so three quotes:

1. "The best is yet to come." – Frank Sinatra. Why: Suggests that the best experiences are still ahead, creating anticipation. 

2. "The future's so bright, I gotta wear shades." – Tim McGraw. Because it implies an exciting future, making people look forward. 

3. "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air." – West Side Story. Conveys an impending event, sparking curiosity. 

Now, which is best? The third one might be better because it's more about the feeling of anticipation building up, which matches the brand goal of sparking curiosity. The second is catchy but maybe more about confidence. The first is classic but a bit generic. 

So mark the third as ★.

Moving to Step 2: Structure breakdown. The best quote is "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air." 

Structure: "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air." 

Separate editable and fixed parts. The key parts that can be replaced are "Something's coming" and "feel it in the air". 

Maybe the "something" can be replaced with the brand, or "coming" could be tied to Coca-Cola's product. 

Step 3: Vocabulary replacement. 

Possible replacements:

Option 1: Replace "Something's" with "The buzz" and "feel it" with "taste it". Because Coca-Cola is about taste. 

So: "The buzz is coming, you can taste it in the air." 

Option 2: Replace "Something's" with "The refreshment" and "feel it" with "crave it". 

"The refreshment is coming, you can crave it in the air." Not sure. 

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola's coming, you can taste it in the air." But that uses the brand name and changes two words. 

Wait, the constraint says change at most two words. Adding the brand name counts. So replacing "Something's" with "Coca-Cola's" and "feel it" with "taste it". 

So: "Coca-Cola's coming, you can taste it in the air." 

That keeps the structure, changes two words (something's -> coca-cola's and feel it -> taste it). 

Alternatively, "The taste is coming, you can feel it in the air." Replacing "something's" with "the taste" and "feel it" to "taste it". 

Hmm. The key is to include brand or keyword. 

Alternatively, "The fizz is coming, you can taste it in the air." Using fizz as a brand attribute. 

But maybe the best is using the brand name directly. 

Step 4: Remix slogan. Using the first option: "Coca-Cola's coming, you can taste it in the air!" 

But need to check the original quote structure: "Something's coming, you can feel it in the air." 

Original has "feel it", changing to "taste it" makes sense for Coca-Cola. 

So the final slogan would be "Coca-Cola's coming, you can taste it in the air!" 

Wait, but the persona goal is to spark curiosity or suspense. Maybe "Coca-Cola's coming, can you taste it in the air?" makes it more of a question, but the original is a statement. 

Alternatively, stick to the structure. 

Yes, that should work. Let me check the constraints: no first-person, brand is mentioned, ends with punctuation. 

Looks good.
