Remix Slogan: "I [action] to begin my life anew!"

Remix Slogan: "Refreshing moments are eagerly anticipated, happiness is joyfully shared." — Coca-Cola : I am thrilled about what we might experience together!

Explanation: The original quote is a famous line from Robert Frost's poem "The Road Not Taken," but here it's being used in a completely different context, suggesting a journey towards refreshing experiences or excitement. This creates anticipation and excitement around the idea of a journey.

Structure: "We have [brand keyword] to go before we [verb]." This structure sets up a sense of expectation by introducing the idea that there is something ahead, and setting the stage for the verb action to take place after reaching that point.

Replacements: "refreshment", "excite" 

Remix Slogan: "We have refreshment to go before we ignite excitement."

Explanation: I replaced "refreshment" with "delight," adding to the anticipation by conveying excitement and joy.
