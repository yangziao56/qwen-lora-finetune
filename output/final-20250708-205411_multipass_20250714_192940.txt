Okay, I need to come up with three quotes that match the Coca-Cola brand and the fear persona, specifically neutralizing fear of missing out or adding urgency. Let's start brainstorming.

First thought: The Coca-Cola slogan often revolves around happiness and togetherness. The fear here is FOMO (fear of missing out), so maybe something that suggests drinking Coke is essential to not missing out on good times.

Quote 1: Maybe "The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page." But that's more about travel. Hmm, not sure. Wait, the user wants something related to fear of missing out. Maybe "You only live once" by DJ Khaled? That's popular and fits the urgency. It's about seizing the moment, so if you don't drink Coke, you might be missing out on life's moments. That works. 

Another quote: "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened." But that's more about moving on, not urgency. Not quite. 

How about "The best things in life are free, but you have to buy the whiskey." Not exactly Coca-Cola. Maybe "What happens here, stays here" from Vegas? No, but maybe a twist. Wait, "The early bird catches the worm" – but that's more about timing. Not sure.

Wait, the user wants to neutralize fear of missing out or add urgency. Maybe "Live every moment to the fullest." Not a quote. Let me think of actual quotes.

Ah, "Carpe diem" from Horace. "Seize the day." That's perfect for urgency. It's a classic quote and fits. So "Carpe diem, seize the day" – but the original is in Latin, so maybe the English version. 

Third quote: Maybe "Happiness is just a sip away" – but that's too similar to existing slogans. Not a real quote. Hmm. 

Wait, the song lyric "Don't stop believin'" by Journey? That's more about hope, but maybe. 

Wait, "Life is a party, so don't miss out" – not a real quote. 

Wait, maybe "The best things in life are free, but you have to buy the bubbles." No, that's a joke. 

Wait, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take" by Wayne Gretzky. That's about taking chances. If you don't take that Coke, you might miss out on the experience. That's good. 

So possible three quotes:

1. "You only live once, so live it right." by DJ Khaled. Matches urgency, live now, so you shouldn't miss out. 

2. "Carpe diem" by Horace. Matches the seize the day urgency, implying don't miss out on moments where you can have Coke.

3. "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take" by Wayne Gretzky. It's about taking action, so if you don't have Coke, you might miss out on the experience. 

Now, which is the best? 

The Gretzky quote is a bit long. The "you only live once" is catchy and shorter, which is good for a slogan. "Carpe diem" is classic but maybe needs more explanation. The DJ Khaled quote is popular and modern, which might resonate more. 

So maybe mark the DJ Khaled quote as best (★). 

Wait, the user wants to neutralize fear of missing out. The Gretzky quote is about taking opportunities, so if you don't take the shot (drink Coke?), you miss out. But maybe the first quote is more directly about living in the moment, which ties to not missing out. 

Alternatively, "Carpe diem" is more about seizing the day, which also works. 

Hmm. Let's list the three with explanations. 

1. "You only live once, so live it right." - DJ Khaled. Matches urgency to enjoy the moment, implying missing out on life's moments without Coke. 

2. "Carpe diem." - Horace. Matches the idea of seizing the moment, suggesting not to wait and enjoy Coke now. 

3. "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take." - Wayne Gretzky. Matches the fear of missing out by highlighting that not acting (drinking Coke) means missing opportunities. 

I think the Gretzky quote is the best match because it directly addresses FOMO by stating that missing opportunities (not taking shots/missing out) happens when you don't act. But the quote is a bit long for a slogan. Alternatively, the "You only live once" is catchier. 

Alternatively, the user wants to neutralize fear of missing out. The Gretzky quote's message is about taking action to avoid missing out, which aligns well. But the phrasing might be too specific. 

Maybe "You only live once" is better because it's concise and can be easily adapted. 

Let me structure the three options as per the instructions.
</think>

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. "You only live once, so live it right." — DJ Khaled  
  Matches urgency to embrace the present, aligning with Coca-Cola’s role in life’s moments.  
2. "Carpe diem." — Horace  
  Encourages seizing the day, neutralizing hesitation and FOMO.  
3. "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take." — Wayne Gretzky  
  Directly addresses fear of missing out by framing inaction as regret.  
★ **Best match**: "You only live once, so live it right." — DJ Khaled (catchy, modern, and action-oriented).  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Structure: "You only live once | , so live it right." |  
Editable parts: "You" (neutral perspective needed), "live once", "live it right".  
Replaceable words: "once" (to tie to Coca-Cola’s role) and "live it right" (to emphasize urgency or inclusion).  

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
1. **Replace "once" → "once with Coke"** and "live it right" → "make it bright":  
   Reason: Integrates the brand while maintaining rhythm and tying Coca-Cola to joy and urgency.  
2. **Replace "once" → "once, drink Coke"** and "live it right" → "live it right":  
   Reason: Directly inserts the brand but feels less seamless.  

Step 4【Remix Generation】  
Remix Slogan: "You only live once with Coke, so make it bright."
