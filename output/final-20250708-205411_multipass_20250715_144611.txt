Okay, I need to come up with three quotes that fit Coca-Cola's brand and the joy tone. Let's see... The goal is to evoke delight or excitement.

First, maybe something from a song or a popular saying that's upbeat. "What's happening?" is a slang that's casual and energetic, but does it fit Coca-Cola? Hmm, maybe not the best. Wait, the user wants quotes, slang, lyrics, or expressions. Let me think of songs associated with happiness. "It's the real thing" is actually a Coca-Cola jingle, but that's their existing slogan. The user probably wants something new. 

Maybe "The best things in life are free, but you can't have them for nothing." But that's more about value. Not sure. Alternatively, "Life is a party" from a song? Oh, there's "Life is a party, and I'll live it as long as I can" by AC/DC. That's energetic and party-like, which matches Coca-Cola's vibe. 

Another option: "Happiness is a warm puppy" by Charlie Brown? Wait, that's from Charles Schulz. But a warm drink? Maybe. Or "Just do it" is Nike's, but not exactly. Maybe "Come together right now over me" from The Beatles' song "Come Together". Not sure. 

Wait, the user wants three sentences. Let me think again. 

First quote: "What’s love got to do with it?" by Tina Turner. Maybe not directly, but love and joy connection? Maybe. 

Wait, maybe "Make every moment a party" – but that's a slogan. 

Wait, another angle: Coca-Cola is often associated with sharing and celebration. "Share a Coke and a smile" – but again existing. 

Alternatively, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return" by Elvis. But that's more about love than excitement. 

Hmm. Let me think of more classic quotes. 

Ah, "Just do it" is Nike, but maybe "Open happiness" is their current slogan. Need to avoid existing ones. 

Wait, the user said remix a classic quote, not original. So need to pick existing quotes. 

Let me think again. 

1. "Life is a party" from AC/DC's "It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)". That's a good fit for joy and celebration. 

2. "What’s happening, Coca-Cola?" – wait, maybe "What's happening" as slang, but need to attribute. 

Wait, maybe "Let’s go all the way" from The Beatles' "Drive My Car". Not quite. 

Alternatively, "Happiness is a warm puppy" by Charles M. Schulz. That's a classic quote. 

Or "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King, but that's a lyric. 

Wait, "Hakuna Matata" means no worries, which is about joy. 

Third option could be "The joy of living is being able to laugh at things." – but that's from someone? Not sure. 

Wait, maybe "Happiness is the best makeup" – quote from somewhere. 

Alternatively, "Laughter is the best medicine" – but more about health. 

Hmm, perhaps "What’s life without a little fun?" by someone? Not sure. 

Wait, let me list three:

1. "Life is a party" from AC/DC. This matches because it's about living joyfully, which aligns with Coca-Cola's association with celebration.

2. "Happiness is a warm puppy" by Charles Schulz. It's about simple joys, which could tie to the pleasure of drinking Coke.

3. "What’s happening?" as slang, representing excitement and connection, fitting the brand's social moments. 

Now, explain why each matches:

1. ★ "Life is a party" captures the essence of enjoying every moment, which Coca-Cola promotes through its association with gatherings and happiness.

2. "Happiness is a warm puppy" connects to the idea of simple, warm pleasures, which the brand can symbolize as a comforting treat.

3. "What’s happening?" reflects the excitement and curiosity of engaging in lively moments, often enhanced by Coca-Cola. 

Wait, the user said to mark the best one with ★. The first one seems better for Coca-Cola's brand as it's more about celebration and ongoing joy. 

Next step is structure breakdown. Take the best quote: "Life is a party | (from AC/DC's song)". Wait, the original quote is "Life is a party, and I'll live it as long as I can". The fixed parts would be "Life is a party" and the rest. But I need to separate editable and fixed parts. Let's see the quote again. The exact lyric is "Life is a party and I'll live it as long as I can". So maybe structure as "Life is a party | and I'll live it as long as I can". Wait, but the user wants to use | to separate editable vs fixed. Hmm. Maybe the fixed part is "Life is a [blank]" and the rest can be adjusted? Wait, maybe the structure should be:

Original quote: "Life is a party, and I'll live it as long as I can."

Breaking into editable and fixed parts. The key part for replacing would be "party" and maybe "live it". Since the brand is Coca-Cola, maybe replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" or similar. But the structure breakdown step requires pointing out which words can be replaced with brand keywords. 

Wait, the structure breakdown step says: Copy the ★ quote and use | to separate editable and fixed parts. Point out which words can be replaced with brand keywords and why.

So for "Life is a party, and I'll live it as long as I can" by AC/DC. The editable part would be "party", since that's the central metaphor. The rest is fixed. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure is:

"Life is a | party | , and I'll live it as long as I can."

But the user wants to separate fixed and editable parts. So the fixed parts are the structure around the key word. The word to replace is "party" with something related to Coca-Cola, like "Coca-Cola moment" or "soda". 

Replacement ideas: "Life is a Coca-Cola moment" – but need to keep the structure. Since the original is "Life is a party", replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola moment" would fit. But "Coca-Cola moment" is two words, but the original is one. Alternatively, "Life is a Coke" – but that's too short. 

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coke moment". Hmm, but the original is "party" (one word). Maybe "Life is a Coke break" or "Life is a Coke sip". 

Alternatively, "Life is a Fanta moment" but that's another brand. 

Wait, the brand is Coca-Cola, so maybe "Life is a Coca-Cola". But that's "Life is a Coca-Cola", which is okay. But the original had "party", so the replacement should be a noun. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke" – but that's possessive? No. "Life is a Coke" could work. 

So the structure breakdown would mark "party" as the editable part. 

Then in vocabulary replacement, possible replacements: 

1. "Life is a Coca-Cola moment" – but the structure is "Life is a [X]". The original has "party", so replacing with "Coca-Cola moment" would fit the idea of moments enhanced by Coke. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke" – shorter. 

Another option: "Life is a fizz" referencing the bubbles of Coke. 

Or "Life is a soda" but too generic. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke can" – but that's a noun phrase. 

So the first replacement idea would be replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola moment". 

Second option: "Life is a Coke" – since "Coke" is a common nickname for Coca-Cola. 

Then the remix slogan would be "Life is a Coke, and I'll live it as long as I can." But the original ends with "as long as I can", but maybe adjust to fit. Wait, the original quote is "Life is a party, and I'll live it as long as I can". So keeping the structure, replacing "party" with "Coke" (since "Coca-Cola" is too long for the rhythm). Let me check syllables:

Original: "Life is a par-ty, and I'll live it as long as I can." (par-ty is two syllables). 

"Coke" is one syllable. So "Life is a Coke" would have one less syllable. Maybe "Life is a Coke moment" would add syllables. Hmm, but the rhythm might be okay. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola moment" is longer, but maybe acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coke can" but that's more about the product. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke and smile" but that's stretching. 

Alternatively, just "Life is a Coke" keeping the rest as is. The rhythm would be okay. 

So the final slogan would be "Life is a Coke, and I'll live it as long as I can." But need to include the brand name properly. Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola moment..." but that might be too long. 

Wait, the constraints say to include brand name/keyword. So maybe "Life is a Coca-Cola moment" as the first part, but the structure after is fixed. Alternatively, adjust the fixed part slightly. 

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment", making the slogan "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and I'll live it as long as I can." But need to check the structure breakdown again. 

Alternatively, the fixed part after "Life is a" is "party", so replacing that with "Coca-Cola moment". 

Another possibility: Use "Life is a Coca-Cola" so it's shorter. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke" is better for brevity. 

Let me think of the exact output steps again. 

Step 1: The three quotes with explanations, best marked with ★. 

Step 2: Structure breakdown with |, pointing out replaceable words. 

Step 3: Replacements. 

Step 4: Final slogan. 

So going back, the best quote is AC/DC's "Life is a party", replacing "party" with Coca-Cola-related terms. 

Final slogan would be "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and I'll live it as long as I can." But maybe the brand name is better as just "Coke". 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke, and I'll live it as long as I can." 

The syllables: 

Original: 8 syllables in "Life is a party" (Life (1) is (1) a (1) par-ty (2) → total 5?), but maybe I'm miscounting. 

Anyway, the user wants to keep the original syntax and meter. So "Life is a Coke" (4 syllables) vs "Life is a party" (4 syllables). 

Yes, "Coke" is one word, same as "party". So replacing "party" with "Coke" keeps the structure. 

So the final slogan would be "Life is a Coke, and I'll live it as long as I can." 

But the brand name is Coca-Cola. Maybe using "Coke" is acceptable as a nickname. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola" but that's a bit longer. 

Hmm, the user says "include brand name / keyword". Using "Coke" is a keyword for Coca-Cola, so that's okay. 

So final slogan would be that. 

I think that works.

Explanation:  
1. “Life is a party, and I’ll live it as long as I can” ★ by AC/DC. Matches because Coca-Cola is tied to joyful, celebratory moments.  
2. “Happiness is a warm puppy” by Charles Schulz. Evokes simple, comforting delight, aligning with Coca-Cola’s nostalgic appeal.

Second option: "Life is a Coke" – since "Coke" is a common nickname for Coca-Cola. 

Then the remix slogan would be "Life is a Coke, and I'll live it as long as I can." But the original ends with "as long as I can", but maybe adjust to fit. Wait, the original quote is "Life is a party, and I'll live it as long as I can". So keeping the structure, replacing "party" with "Coke" (since "Coca-Cola" is too long for the rhythm). Let me check syllables:

Original: "Life is a par-ty, and I'll live it as long as I can." (par-ty is two syllables). 

"Coke" is one syllable. So "Life is a Coke" would have one less syllable. Maybe "Life is a Coke moment" would add syllables. Hmm, but the rhythm might be okay. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola moment" is longer, but maybe acceptable. 

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coke can" but that's more about the product. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke and smile" but that's stretching. 

Alternatively, just "Life is a Coke" keeping the rest as is. The rhythm would be okay. 

So the final slogan would be "Life is a Coke, and I'll live it as long as I can." But need to include the brand name properly. Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola moment..." but that might be too long. 

Wait, the constraints say to include brand name/keyword. So maybe "Life is a Coca-Cola moment" as the first part, but the structure after is fixed. Alternatively, adjust the fixed part slightly. 

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to replace "party" with "Coca-Cola moment", making the slogan "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and I'll live it as long as I can." But need to check the structure breakdown again. 

Alternatively, the fixed part after "Life is a" is "party", so replacing that with "Coca-Cola moment". 

Another possibility: Use "Life is a Coca-Cola" so it's shorter. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke" is better for brevity. 

Let me think of the exact output steps again. 

Step 1: The three quotes with explanations, best marked with ★. 

Step 2: Structure breakdown with |, pointing out replaceable words. 

Step 3: Replacements. 

Step 4: Final slogan. 

So going back, the best quote is AC/DC's "Life is a party", replacing "party" with Coca-Cola-related terms. 

Final slogan would be "Life is a Coca-Cola moment, and I'll live it as long as I can." But maybe the brand name is better as just "Coke". 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coke, and I'll live it as long as I can." 

The syllables: 

Original: 8 syllables in "Life is a party" (Life (1) is (1) a (1) par-ty (2) → total 5?), but maybe I'm miscounting. 

Anyway, the user wants to keep the original syntax and meter. So "Life is a Coke" (4 syllables) vs "Life is a party" (4 syllables). 

Yes, "Coke" is one word, same as "party". So replacing "party" with "Coke" keeps the structure. 

So the final slogan would be "Life is a Coke, and I'll live it as long as I can." 

But the brand name is Coca-Cola. Maybe using "Coke" is acceptable as a nickname. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola" but that's a bit longer. 

Hmm, the user says "include brand name / keyword". Using "Coke" is a keyword for Coca-Cola, so that's okay. 

So final slogan would be that. 

I think that works.

Explanation:  
1. “Life is a party, and I’ll live it as long as I can” ★ by AC/DC. Matches because Coca-Cola is tied to joyful, celebratory moments.  
2. “Happiness is a warm puppy” by Charles Schulz. Evokes simple, comforting delight, aligning with Coca-Cola’s nostalgic appeal.  
3. “What’s happening?” slang. Reflects excitement and connection, key to Coca-Cola’s social vibe.  

Structure:  
Life is a | party | , and I'll live it as long as I can.  
Replace **party** (central metaphor for joy) with a brand-linked term.  

Replacements:  
1. **Coca-Cola** → “Life is a Coca-Cola, and I’ll live it as long as I can.” (Replaces “party” with the brand name to directly link Coca-Cola to joy.)  
2. **Coke** → “Life is a Coke, and I’ll live it as long as I can.” (Shortened nickname for Coca-Cola, preserving rhythm.)  

Remix Slogan:  
“Life is a Coca-Cola, and I’ll live it as long as I can.”
