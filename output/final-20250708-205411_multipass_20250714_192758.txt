Okay, I need to come up with three quotes that fit the persona of anticipation for Coca-Cola. The goal is to spark curiosity or suspense. Let me think about quotes related to waiting, excitement, or something that builds up. 

First, maybe "Something's coming, and it's going to be big." That's from West Side Story. It definitely has that sense of something to come, which fits anticipation. The user might like that because it's about building up to a big event, which Coca-Cola can tie into moments of celebration.

Second, "The best things in life are worth the wait." That's from a Nike ad. It's about patience leading to something great. Since Coca-Cola is often associated with happy moments, this could work by making people wait for that moment with a Coke.

Third, "You can't rush perfection." by Leonardo DiCaprio. Hmm, maybe not as strong for anticipation. It's more about taking time rather than building excitement. Maybe not the best, but still possible.

Wait, maybe the first one is the best because it directly mentions something coming, creating suspense. The second one is good too but more about waiting. The third is less about anticipation. Let me check authors again. The Nike quote is actually from a Nike commercial, so the author would be Nike. The Leonardo one is a quote from him. 

So the best match is probably the first one from West Side Story. The second is also good but maybe the first is better for suspense. 

Now, structuring the three quotes with explanations. I'll need to mark the best with a star. Let me make sure each has a reason. The first's reason is that it creates suspense about an upcoming event. The second emphasizes that waiting leads to reward. The third suggests quality over speed, which might not be as directly tied to anticipation. So the first is the best.
