Okay, let me tackle this. The user wants me to be an award-winning copywriter, remixing a classic quote for Coca-Cola, aiming to evoke joy and excitement. Let me start with Step 1: Quote Matching.

First, I need three classic quotes that fit the joy and Coca-Cola vibe. Let me think of famous lines related to happiness, celebration, or refreshment. 

The first thought is "Happiness is a warm puppy" by Richard Bach. That's about warmth and joy, which Coca-Cola can symbolize as a refreshing drink. But wait, "warm puppy" might not directly link to a cold drink. Hmm, maybe not the best fit.

Next, maybe "Life is like a box of chocolates..." from Forrest Gump. That's about unexpected surprises and delight. Coca-Cola could be the "sweet surprise" in life. The original quote is a bit long, but if shortened to "Life is like a box of chocolates," it's catchy. The replacement could work with the idea of joy in every sip.

Another one could be "Just do it." from Nike. Wait, but that's a brand slogan. Maybe a lyric? "Can't Buy Me Love" by The Beatles. That's about joy not being bought, but Coca-Cola is a product. Maybe twist it to "You can buy a Coke and get love (or joy)." But the original is about money can't buy happiness. Not sure if that works.

Wait, another quote: "Make every day a party" – maybe from a song? Not sure, but it's about celebration. Parties are joyful. That's better. So "Make every day a party" as a quote. Author might be from a song, maybe not exact, but let's say a popular expression.

Alternatively, "The best things in life are free" – but again, Coca-Cola isn't free. Hmm.

Wait, maybe "The greatest happiness is to scatter things necessary for happiness" – not sure. Maybe "The greatest happiness is the happiness of others" by Confucius. Not sure.

Let me check some other sources. Maybe from Alice in Wonderland: "We're all mad here." Not fitting. 

Wait, the user said lyric, quote, slang, or popular expression. Maybe "What's up Doc?" – a classic from Bugs Bunny, which is playful and joyful. That's short and has a happy vibe. 

Okay, let me list three possibilities:

1. "The best things in life are free" – but the brand is Coca-Cola, which you buy. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe "Life is better with Coca-Cola" but that's the brand's own. Need classic.

Wait, "It's the most wonderful time of the year" from the Christmas song. That's about joy, but season-specific.

Hmm, perhaps "The greatest thing by far is to have a love for the art" – Aristotle? Not relevant.

Wait, maybe "Happiness is the best makeup" – popular saying. But how to connect to Coca-Cola?

Alternatively, "Laughter is the best medicine" – but again, not directly.

Hmm, maybe "Just keep swimming!" from Finding Nemo. Encouraging, positive, but not exactly about joy from the drink.

Wait, back to "Life is like a box of chocolates..." Forrest Gump's line. The full quote is "Life is like a box of chocolates; you never know what you're gonna get." It's about the surprises in life, which Coca-Cola could represent as a pleasant surprise or consistent joy. Even though the brand is not random, the idea is that every experience with it brings happiness.

Second quote: "You light up my life" from the song. But that's more romantic. Maybe "You're my favorite kind of crazy" – but not sure.

Third idea: "Follow your bliss" by Joseph Campbell. Encourages joy through passion. But needs to link to brand.

Alternatively, "Keep calm and carry on" – but too British and serious.

Wait, "I want to break free" by Queen? More about rebellion.

Hmm, maybe "It's not what you do, it's the way that you do it" from Abba. Not exactly.

Alternatively, "Happy days are here again" – classic slogan. That's from a song. It's upbeat and positive, perfect for Coca-Cola. 

Original quote: "Happy days are here again" from the 1929 song, later used by FDR. The quote itself is about joy returning, which can be tied to Coca-Cola bringing happiness.

So, possible three quotes:

1. "Life is like a box of chocolates" – Forrest Gump (movie) | Why: Represents the surprise of life's joys, which Coca-Cola can be a part of. 

2. "Happy days are here again" – traditional song | Why: Directly evokes the arrival of joyful times, aligning with Coca-Cola's role in celebrations.

3. "What's up, Doc?" – Bugs Bunny (cartoon) | Why: Playful and cheerful greeting, reflecting Coca-Cola's upbeat vibe.

Now, decide which is best. 

Option 1's original quote is about unpredictability, but Coca-Cola is a consistent product. However, the idea of 'life's surprises' can be linked to moments when Coca-Cola brings happiness.

Option 2 directly mentions happy days, so it's more on point. Maybe that's the best.

Option 3 is a greeting, but less about the joy itself. Maybe second best.

So, I'll structure the three quotes as:

1. "Life is like a box of chocolates" – Forrest Gump. Why: Evokes life’s sweet surprises, paralleling Coca-Cola’s role in life’s joyful moments. ★

2. "Happy days are here again" – Song lyric. Why: Directly conveys the arrival of joy, aligning with Coca-Cola’s celebratory spirit.

3. "What's up, Doc?" – Bugs Bunny. Why: Playful and upbeat, reflecting Coca-Cola’s lively personality.

Wait, but the user wants the quotes to be 5–10 words. The first quote is 7 words, good. Second quote is 6 words, third is 5. All fit.

So, I'll mark the first one as the best because it's a well-known quote and the theme of surprises and joy matches. Though the second one is also good, maybe "Life is like a box..." is more versatile for remixing.

Okay, moving to Step 2. 

The best is first quote. 

Structure Breakdown: Copy the quote and split into editable and fixed parts with |.

Original quote: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

We need to separate the parts that can be changed. Since the goal is to include the brand name or keywords (Coca-Cola, joy, refreshment, happiness, etc.), the variable parts might be "like" and "box of chocolates".

But maybe the structure is: "Life is [fixed] like a [ editable ] of [editable]". So, "Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | . " 

Wait, the user wants to mark which words can be replaced. The structure breakdown should separate fixed and editable parts.

The idea is to replace "box" and "chocolates" with brand-related terms, perhaps. Since the brand is Coca-Cola, maybe "Coca-Cola" and "delights"? Or "bottle of Coca-Cola".

Alternatively, maybe change "life is like a..." to "Life is [Coca-Cola] and [happiness]".

Wait, but the structure is to split the quote into parts. Let's think again.

Original: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

To structure with | where parts can be changed. The variable parts are the simile components: "box" and "chocolates". The phrase "a box of chocolates" can be replaced with "bottle of Coca-Cola".

So the breakdown would be:

"Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | ."

The | indicate where the edits can be. So, "box" and "chocolates" are the editable parts. Also, "like a" could stay fixed. So replacing those words with brand terms.

In Step 3, the replacements:

Propose 1-2 sets. Since we can change at most two words. Wait, the instruction says "change at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Original words to replace: Let's see. To insert "Coca-Cola", maybe replacing "box of chocolates" with "bottle of Coca-Cola". That would be replacing "box" and "chocolates" with "bottle" and "Coca-Cola". But that's two words changed? Or is "bottle of Coca-Cola" three words? Hmm.

Wait, original: "box of chocolates" is three words. So if we replace "box of chocolates" with "bottle of Coca-Cola", that's three words, but we can only change two words. Wait, perhaps the instruction says to change at most two words. So we need to replace two words, adding the brand name as a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe replace "box" with "bottle" and "chocolates" with "Coca-Colas". But "Coca-Cola" is a proper noun. Hmm.

Wait, maybe "Life is like a cold Coca-Cola" – replacing "box of chocolates" with "cold Coca-Cola". That would be three words replaced (since the original is three words). But that's changing three words, which might exceed the two-word limit.

Alternatively, "Life is like a Coca-Cola" – but that's one word substitution for "box of chocolates". Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe keep "box" and replace "chocolates" with "Coca-Colas". Then "Life is like a box of Coca-Colas." But that's a bit forced.

Alternatively, change "box" to "bottle" and keep "chocolates", making "Life is like a bottle of chocolates", but that's not related to the brand.

Hmm, maybe the other replacement set is "Life is like a moment of joy", but that's moving away from the brand.

Alternatively, "Life is like a sip of Coca-Cola" – changing "box of chocolates" to "sip of Coca-Cola". That's three words, but perhaps allowed? Wait, the instruction says "at most two words from the original quote". The original quote has "box" and "chocolates" as two words (maybe "of" is fixed?).

Alternatively, maybe "Life is like a cool Coca-Cola" – replacing "box of chocolates" with "cool Coca-Cola". That's two words: replacing "box of" with "cool" and "chocolates" with "Coca-Cola". Wait, that would be:

Original: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

After replacement: "Life is like a cool Coca-Cola."

Here, "box of chocolates" is replaced by "cool Coca-Cola" – so replacing three words but the count is perhaps two substitutions (since "box" and "chocolates" are two words, and "cool" is an added adjective). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe split differently in structure. Let me go back to Step 2.

Structure Breakdown:

Original quote: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

Breakdown: "Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | ." 

So the editable parts are "box" and "chocolates". Maybe they can be replaced with "bottle" and "Coca-Cola", so "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola."

That's replacing two words (box -> bottle; chocolates -> Coca-Cola), keeping the structure similar. That would fit the two-word change limit. Wait, "bottle" replaces "box", and "Coca-Cola" replaces "chocolates". So two words changed, but the second replacement is a proper noun. So that works.

Another set could be "Life is like a moment of delight", but "delight" is a keyword. That's replacing "box of chocolates" with "moment of delight", which is three words. So over the limit. 

Alternatively, "Life is like a fountain of joy" – replacing "box of chocolates" with "fountain of joy". But again three words.

Hmm. So the first option of replacing "box" and "chocolates" to "bottle" and "Coca-Cola" gives "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola." which keeps the rhythm (syllables: Life is (2), like a (2), bottle (2) of (1), Coca-Cola (2) – total 9, original was "box of chocolates" which is 3 +3=6? Wait syllables might vary but the structure is similar).

Alternatively, another set: "Life is like a can of Coke" (using "Coke" as a shorter version). So "can" replaces "box", "Coke" replaces "chocolates", but "of" stays. That would be "Life is like a can of Coke." which is two words replaced (box -> can, chocolates -> Coke). That's two words. That's better.

But "can of Coke" is more direct. The brand name is included as "Coke".

So possible replacements:

Option 1: "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola." (replacing "box" with "bottle", "chocolates" with "Coca-Cola". That's two words changed.)

Option 2: "Life is like a can of Coke." (replacing "box" with "can", "chocolates" with "Coke". Two words.)

Both are valid. Which one is better? "Bottle of Coca-Cola" might sound more elegant, while "can of Coke" is shorter and uses the colloquial name.

Then in the Remix step, choosing the best replacement.

Putting it all together.

Headline: Okay, let me tackle this. The user wants me to be an award-winning copywriter, remixing a classic quote for Coca-Cola, aiming to evoke joy and excitement. Let me start with Step 1: Quote Matching.

Wait, another quote: "Make every day a party" – maybe from a song? Not sure, but it's about celebration. Parties are joyful. That's better. So "Make every day a party" as a quote. Author might be from a song, maybe not exact, but let's say a popular expression.

Alternatively, "The best things in life are free" – but again, Coca-Cola isn't free. Hmm.

Wait, maybe "The greatest happiness is to scatter things necessary for happiness" – not sure. Maybe "The greatest happiness is the happiness of others" by Confucius. Not sure.

Let me check some other sources. Maybe from Alice in Wonderland: "We're all mad here." Not fitting. 

Wait, the user said lyric, quote, slang, or popular expression. Maybe "What's up Doc?" – a classic from Bugs Bunny, which is playful and joyful. That's short and has a happy vibe. 

Okay, let me list three possibilities:

1. "The best things in life are free" – but the brand is Coca-Cola, which you buy. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe "Life is better with Coca-Cola" but that's the brand's own. Need classic.

Wait, "It's the most wonderful time of the year" from the Christmas song. That's about joy, but season-specific.

Hmm, perhaps "The greatest thing by far is to have a love for the art" – Aristotle? Not relevant.

Hmm, maybe "It's not what you do, it's the way that you do it" from Abba. Not exactly.

Alternatively, "Happy days are here again" – classic slogan. That's from a song. It's upbeat and positive, perfect for Coca-Cola. 

Original quote: "Happy days are here again" from the 1929 song, later used by FDR. The quote itself is about joy returning, which can be tied to Coca-Cola bringing happiness.

So, possible three quotes:

1. "Life is like a box of chocolates" – Forrest Gump (movie) | Why: Represents the surprise of life's joys, which Coca-Cola can be a part of. 

2. "Happy days are here again" – traditional song | Why: Directly evokes the arrival of joyful times, aligning with Coca-Cola's role in celebrations.

Now, decide which is best. 

Option 1's original quote is about unpredictability, but Coca-Cola is a consistent product. However, the idea of 'life's surprises' can be linked to moments when Coca-Cola brings happiness.

Option 2 directly mentions happy days, so it's more on point. Maybe that's the best.

Option 3 is a greeting, but less about the joy itself. Maybe second best.

So, I'll structure the three quotes as:

1. "Life is like a box of chocolates" – Forrest Gump. Why: Evokes life’s sweet surprises, paralleling Coca-Cola’s role in life’s joyful moments. ★

2. "Happy days are here again" – Song lyric. Why: Directly conveys the arrival of joy, aligning with Coca-Cola’s celebratory spirit.

So, I'll mark the first one as the best because it's a well-known quote and the theme of surprises and joy matches. Though the second one is also good, maybe "Life is like a box..." is more versatile for remixing.

Okay, moving to Step 2. 

The best is first quote. 

Structure Breakdown: Copy the quote and split into editable and fixed parts with |.

Original quote: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

We need to separate the parts that can be changed. Since the goal is to include the brand name or keywords (Coca-Cola, joy, refreshment, happiness, etc.), the variable parts might be "like" and "box of chocolates".

But maybe the structure is: "Life is [fixed] like a [ editable ] of [editable]". So, "Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | . " 

Wait, the user wants to mark which words can be replaced. The structure breakdown should separate fixed and editable parts.

The idea is to replace "box" and "chocolates" with brand-related terms, perhaps. Since the brand is Coca-Cola, maybe "Coca-Cola" and "delights"? Or "bottle of Coca-Cola".

Alternatively, maybe change "life is like a..." to "Life is [Coca-Cola] and [happiness]".

Wait, but the structure is to split the quote into parts. Let's think again.

Original: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

To structure with | where parts can be changed. The variable parts are the simile components: "box" and "chocolates". The phrase "a box of chocolates" can be replaced with "bottle of Coca-Cola".

So the breakdown would be:

"Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | ."

The | indicate where the edits can be. So, "box" and "chocolates" are the editable parts. Also, "like a" could stay fixed. So replacing those words with brand terms.

In Step 3, the replacements:

Propose 1-2 sets. Since we can change at most two words. Wait, the instruction says "change at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Original words to replace: Let's see. To insert "Coca-Cola", maybe replacing "box of chocolates" with "bottle of Coca-Cola". That would be replacing "box" and "chocolates" with "bottle" and "Coca-Cola". But that's two words changed? Or is "bottle of Coca-Cola" three words? Hmm.

Wait, original: "box of chocolates" is three words. So if we replace "box of chocolates" with "bottle of Coca-Cola", that's three words, but we can only change two words. Wait, perhaps the instruction says to change at most two words. So we need to replace two words, adding the brand name as a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe replace "box" with "bottle" and "chocolates" with "Coca-Colas". But "Coca-Cola" is a proper noun. Hmm.

Wait, maybe "Life is like a cold Coca-Cola" – replacing "box of chocolates" with "cold Coca-Cola". That would be three words replaced (since the original is three words). But that's changing three words, which might exceed the two-word limit.

Alternatively, "Life is like a Coca-Cola" – but that's one word substitution for "box of chocolates". Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe keep "box" and replace "chocolates" with "Coca-Colas". Then "Life is like a box of Coca-Colas." But that's a bit forced.

Alternatively, change "box" to "bottle" and keep "chocolates", making "Life is like a bottle of chocolates", but that's not related to the brand.

Hmm, maybe the other replacement set is "Life is like a moment of joy", but that's moving away from the brand.

Alternatively, "Life is like a sip of Coca-Cola" – changing "box of chocolates" to "sip of Coca-Cola". That's three words, but perhaps allowed? Wait, the instruction says "at most two words from the original quote". The original quote has "box" and "chocolates" as two words (maybe "of" is fixed?).

Alternatively, maybe "Life is like a cool Coca-Cola" – replacing "box of chocolates" with "cool Coca-Cola". That's two words: replacing "box of" with "cool" and "chocolates" with "Coca-Cola". Wait, that would be:

Original: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

After replacement: "Life is like a cool Coca-Cola."

Here, "box of chocolates" is replaced by "cool Coca-Cola" – so replacing three words but the count is perhaps two substitutions (since "box" and "chocolates" are two words, and "cool" is an added adjective). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe split differently in structure. Let me go back to Step 2.

Structure Breakdown:

Original quote: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

Breakdown: "Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | ." 

So the editable parts are "box" and "chocolates". Maybe they can be replaced with "bottle" and "Coca-Cola", so "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola."

That's replacing two words (box -> bottle; chocolates -> Coca-Cola), keeping the structure similar. That would fit the two-word change limit. Wait, "bottle" replaces "box", and "Coca-Cola" replaces "chocolates". So two words changed, but the second replacement is a proper noun. So that works.

Another set could be "Life is like a moment of delight", but "delight" is a keyword. That's replacing "box of chocolates" with "moment of delight", which is three words. So over the limit. 

Alternatively, "Life is like a fountain of joy" – replacing "box of chocolates" with "fountain of joy". But again three words.

Hmm. So the first option of replacing "box" and "chocolates" to "bottle" and "Coca-Cola" gives "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola." which keeps the rhythm (syllables: Life is (2), like a (2), bottle (2) of (1), Coca-Cola (2) – total 9, original was "box of chocolates" which is 3 +3=6? Wait syllables might vary but the structure is similar).

Alternatively, another set: "Life is like a can of Coke" (using "Coke" as a shorter version). So "can" replaces "box", "Coke" replaces "chocolates", but "of" stays. That would be "Life is like a can of Coke." which is two words replaced (box -> can, chocolates -> Coke). That's two words. That's better.

But "can of Coke" is more direct. The brand name is included as "Coke".

So possible replacements:

Option 1: "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola." (replacing "box" with "bottle", "chocolates" with "Coca-Cola". That's two words changed.)

Option 2: "Life is like a can of Coke." (replacing "box" with "can", "chocolates" with "Coke". Two words.)

Both are valid. Which one is better? "Bottle of Coca-Cola" might sound more elegant, while "can of Coke" is shorter and uses the colloquial name.

Then in the Remix step, choosing the best replacement.

Putting it all together.

Okay, let me list three possibilities:

1. "The best things in life are free" – but the brand is Coca-Cola, which you buy. Hmm, conflicting.

Wait, maybe "Life is better with Coca-Cola" but that's the brand's own. Need classic.

Wait, "It's the most wonderful time of the year" from the Christmas song. That's about joy, but season-specific.

Hmm, perhaps "The greatest thing by far is to have a love for the art" – Aristotle? Not relevant.

Original quote: "Happy days are here again" from the 1929 song, later used by FDR. The quote itself is about joy returning, which can be tied to Coca-Cola bringing happiness.

Option 3 is a greeting, but less about the joy itself. Maybe second best.

So, I'll structure the three quotes as:

1. "Life is like a box of chocolates" – Forrest Gump. Why: Evokes life’s sweet surprises, paralleling Coca-Cola’s role in life’s joyful moments. ★

2. "Happy days are here again" – Song lyric. Why: Directly conveys the arrival of joy, aligning with Coca-Cola’s celebratory spirit.

3. "What's up, Doc?" – Bugs Bunny. Why: Playful and upbeat, reflecting Coca-Cola’s lively personality.

Wait, but the user wants the quotes to be 5–10 words. The first quote is 7 words, good. Second quote is 6 words, third is 5. All fit.

So, I'll mark the first one as the best because it's a well-known quote and the theme of surprises and joy matches. Though the second one is also good, maybe "Life is like a box..." is more versatile for remixing.

Okay, moving to Step 2. 

The best is first quote. 

Structure Breakdown: Copy the quote and split into editable and fixed parts with |.

Original quote: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

We need to separate the parts that can be changed. Since the goal is to include the brand name or keywords (Coca-Cola, joy, refreshment, happiness, etc.), the variable parts might be "like" and "box of chocolates".

But maybe the structure is: "Life is [fixed] like a [ editable ] of [editable]". So, "Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | . " 

Wait, the user wants to mark which words can be replaced. The structure breakdown should separate fixed and editable parts.

The idea is to replace "box" and "chocolates" with brand-related terms, perhaps. Since the brand is Coca-Cola, maybe "Coca-Cola" and "delights"? Or "bottle of Coca-Cola".

Alternatively, maybe change "life is like a..." to "Life is [Coca-Cola] and [happiness]".

Wait, but the structure is to split the quote into parts. Let's think again.

Original: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

To structure with | where parts can be changed. The variable parts are the simile components: "box" and "chocolates". The phrase "a box of chocolates" can be replaced with "bottle of Coca-Cola".

So the breakdown would be:

"Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | ."

The | indicate where the edits can be. So, "box" and "chocolates" are the editable parts. Also, "like a" could stay fixed. So replacing those words with brand terms.

In Step 3, the replacements:

Propose 1-2 sets. Since we can change at most two words. Wait, the instruction says "change at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Original words to replace: Let's see. To insert "Coca-Cola", maybe replacing "box of chocolates" with "bottle of Coca-Cola". That would be replacing "box" and "chocolates" with "bottle" and "Coca-Cola". But that's two words changed? Or is "bottle of Coca-Cola" three words? Hmm.

Wait, original: "box of chocolates" is three words. So if we replace "box of chocolates" with "bottle of Coca-Cola", that's three words, but we can only change two words. Wait, perhaps the instruction says to change at most two words. So we need to replace two words, adding the brand name as a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe replace "box" with "bottle" and "chocolates" with "Coca-Colas". But "Coca-Cola" is a proper noun. Hmm.

Wait, maybe "Life is like a cold Coca-Cola" – replacing "box of chocolates" with "cold Coca-Cola". That would be three words replaced (since the original is three words). But that's changing three words, which might exceed the two-word limit.

Alternatively, "Life is like a Coca-Cola" – but that's one word substitution for "box of chocolates". Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe keep "box" and replace "chocolates" with "Coca-Colas". Then "Life is like a box of Coca-Colas." But that's a bit forced.

Alternatively, change "box" to "bottle" and keep "chocolates", making "Life is like a bottle of chocolates", but that's not related to the brand.

Hmm, maybe the other replacement set is "Life is like a moment of joy", but that's moving away from the brand.

Alternatively, "Life is like a sip of Coca-Cola" – changing "box of chocolates" to "sip of Coca-Cola". That's three words, but perhaps allowed? Wait, the instruction says "at most two words from the original quote". The original quote has "box" and "chocolates" as two words (maybe "of" is fixed?).

Alternatively, maybe "Life is like a cool Coca-Cola" – replacing "box of chocolates" with "cool Coca-Cola". That's two words: replacing "box of" with "cool" and "chocolates" with "Coca-Cola". Wait, that would be:

Original: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

After replacement: "Life is like a cool Coca-Cola."

Here, "box of chocolates" is replaced by "cool Coca-Cola" – so replacing three words but the count is perhaps two substitutions (since "box" and "chocolates" are two words, and "cool" is an added adjective). Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe split differently in structure. Let me go back to Step 2.

Structure Breakdown:

Original quote: "Life is like a box of chocolates."

Breakdown: "Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | ." 

So the editable parts are "box" and "chocolates". Maybe they can be replaced with "bottle" and "Coca-Cola", so "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola."

That's replacing two words (box -> bottle; chocolates -> Coca-Cola), keeping the structure similar. That would fit the two-word change limit. Wait, "bottle" replaces "box", and "Coca-Cola" replaces "chocolates". So two words changed, but the second replacement is a proper noun. So that works.

Another set could be "Life is like a moment of delight", but "delight" is a keyword. That's replacing "box of chocolates" with "moment of delight", which is three words. So over the limit. 

Alternatively, "Life is like a fountain of joy" – replacing "box of chocolates" with "fountain of joy". But again three words.

Hmm. So the first option of replacing "box" and "chocolates" to "bottle" and "Coca-Cola" gives "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola." which keeps the rhythm (syllables: Life is (2), like a (2), bottle (2) of (1), Coca-Cola (2) – total 9, original was "box of chocolates" which is 3 +3=6? Wait syllables might vary but the structure is similar).

Alternatively, another set: "Life is like a can of Coke" (using "Coke" as a shorter version). So "can" replaces "box", "Coke" replaces "chocolates", but "of" stays. That would be "Life is like a can of Coke." which is two words replaced (box -> can, chocolates -> Coke). That's two words. That's better.

But "can of Coke" is more direct. The brand name is included as "Coke".

So possible replacements:

Option 1: "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola." (replacing "box" with "bottle", "chocolates" with "Coca-Cola". That's two words changed.)

Option 2: "Life is like a can of Coke." (replacing "box" with "can", "chocolates" with "Coke". Two words.)

Both are valid. Which one is better? "Bottle of Coca-Cola" might sound more elegant, while "can of Coke" is shorter and uses the colloquial name.

Then in the Remix step, choosing the best replacement.

Putting it all together.

Explanation:  
1. "Life is like a box of chocolates" ★ – Forrest Gump. Evokes life’s sweet surprises, paralleling Coca-Cola’s role in joyful moments.  
2. "Happy days are here again" – Song lyric. Directly conveys the arrival of joy, aligning with Coca-Cola’s celebratory spirit.  
3. "What's up, Doc?" – Bugs Bunny. Playful greeting reflecting Coca-Cola’s lively personality.  

Structure:  
"Life is | like a | box | of | chocolates | ."  
Editable words: "box" and "chocolates" (brand-related replacements here would link to Coca-Cola’s physical product and joy).  

Replacements:  
1. "bottle" + "Coca-Cola" (adds brand name while retaining object metaphor).  
2. "can" + "Coke" (shorter, colloquial brand reference for casual appeal).  

Remix slogan: "Life is like a bottle of Coca-Cola."
