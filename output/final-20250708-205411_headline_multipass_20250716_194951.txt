Okay, I need to work on this query for the user. Let me start by understanding the task. The persona is "Joy" with the goal of evoking delight or excitement, and the brand is Photoshop. The user wants me to remix a classic quote into a brand slogan following specific steps.

Starting with Step 1: Quote Matching. I need three classic sentences that fit the mood of joy and relate to Photoshop. Each should be 5-10 words. Let's brainstorm. 

First thought: Maybe a quote about creativity or beauty since Photoshop is about editing and enhancing images. 

Option 1: "The sky's the limit!" – usually anonymous, but sometimes attributed to various sources. This phrase suggests endless possibilities, which aligns with Photoshop's creative potential. That could work.

Option 2: "Everything is awesome!" from The Lego Movie. The Lego Movie is all about creativity and building, so this lyric emphasizes fun and excitement, which matches the joy tone and Photoshop's ability to make anything possible. Plus, it's a popular modern reference.

Option 3: "I'm loving it!" from McDonald's. Wait, but that's a slogan itself. Maybe a better choice would be a more classic quote. Alternatively, "Life is a party!" from a song? Not sure. Maybe "The best things in life are free," but that's not about excitement. Hmm. 

Alternatively, "The possibilities are endless." That's a common saying. Maybe from somewhere? Not sure, but it could be a general saying. Let me think of another. 

"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder." But that's more about perception. Alternatively, "Play is the highest form of research." Einstein. That's about creativity, so maybe applicable. 

Wait, I need three options. Let me list again. 

1. "The sky's the limit!" – fits as it suggests limitless creativity. 

2. "Everything is awesome!" – fun and positive, aligns with joy and Photoshop's versatility. 

3. "The world is your canvas." – attributed to various, but it's a common phrase. Canvas relates to Photoshop's interface. 

Wait, the user wants each quote to be a classic sentence, so maybe "The world is your oyster" from Shakespeare. But that's not exactly a canvas. Alternatively, "The possibilities are endless" might be better. 

Alternatively, "Make every moment count" – but not sure. Let me confirm. 

Wait, the first two quotes I thought of: "The sky's the limit" and "Everything is awesome" are good. The third could be "The best things in life are free" but that's not about creativity. Hmm. Alternatively, "The greatest glory in living is to be a force of nature." Maybe not. 

Alternatively, "The future is bright." But not sure. 

Wait, maybe "Life is beautiful" from the movie. But that's more general. 

Alternatively, "Play is the highest form of research." Einstein. That's a quote about creativity through play, which ties into using Photoshop creatively. 

So let me structure three:

1. "The sky's the limit!" – anonymous. Matches because it suggests endless creative possibilities in editing images.

2. "Everything is awesome!" – The Lego Movie lyrics. Matches because it conveys excitement and joy in creation, fitting Photoshop's fun aspect.

3. "Play is the highest form of research." – Einstein. Matches because Photoshop allows users to experiment playfully, aligning with creative research.

Wait, but the third one is longer than 10 words. Let me check. "Play is the highest form of research." That's 8 words. Okay. 

Alternatively, "The possibilities are endless." 5 words, but I'm not sure of the source. Maybe better to use the Einstein quote. 

Alternatively, maybe "The world is your playground" – not sure the origin. 

Hmm. Let me go with those three. 

Now, the best match would be "Everything is awesome!" since it's upbeat and directly ties to the joy tone, plus Photoshop can make any project awesome. 

Moving to Step 2: Structure breakdown of the best quote. Let's pick the Lego one. 

The original quote: "Everything is awesome!" 

Breaking it down with | separators. Fixed parts are " is " and the end punctuation. The editable parts are "Everything" and "awesome". 

So structure: Everything | is | awesome! 

The replaceable words are "Everything" and "awesome" with brand keywords. "Everything" could be replaced with a Photoshop-related noun like "Your photos" or "Edits". "Awesome" could be replaced with a verb or adjective related to Photoshop's effects, like "Photoshopped" or "Perfect".

Step 3: Replacements. 

First set: Replace "Everything" with "Your edits" and "awesome" with "perfect". Reason: Emphasizes that edits in Photoshop can be perfect, tying to quality. 

Second set: "Every image" | "epic" – so "Every image is epic!" But "epic" might not be as strong. 

Alternatively, "Your creativity" | "limitless" → "Your creativity is limitless!" But that's changing both parts. 

Wait, the instruction says change at most two words. Since the original quote is "Everything is awesome", changing "Everything" and "awesome" is two words. 

So maybe "Your photos are magical!" since Photoshop can make photos magical. "Magical" is a positive adjective. 

Alternatively, "Your vision is limitless!" 

Alternatively, "Every project is vibrant!" 

Hmm, perhaps the best is "Your edits are limitless!" But "limitless" might not fit the structure. 

Alternatively, "Every image is awesome!" but keeps "awesome". 

Wait, maybe "Every project is perfect!" 

Wait, the brand is Photoshop, so perhaps including the brand name. 

Wait, the instructions say to include the brand name or keyword. So perhaps "Photoshop makes everything magical!" But that's changing more words. Wait, the original structure is "Everything | is | awesome!". To add the brand name, maybe the structure needs adjustment. 

Alternatively, the remix should end with the brand. Maybe the final slogan could be "Your edits are limitless with Photoshop!" but that's adding a phrase. 

Wait, the structure step is part of the process. Let me re-express. 

Original quote: "Everything is awesome!" 

The remix needs to include brand name. So maybe replacing "Everything" with "Your creations" and "awesome" with "Photoshopped" → "Your creations are Photoshopped!" but that might not be good. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop: everything is perfect!" 

Hmm, perhaps "Every project is magical with Photoshop!" but the structure is "Everything is awesome", so maybe "Every project is Photoshop perfect!" 

Alternatively, "Your photos are perfect with Photoshop!" 

Wait, the structure breakdown allows changing two words. Let me try:

Option 1: Replace "Everything" with "Your vision" and "awesome" with "limitless". So "Your vision is limitless!" but that's removing "awesome". 

Alternatively, "Your edits are limitless!" but again. 

Alternatively, keep "awesome" and replace "everything" with "Photoshop" → "Photoshop is awesome!" But that's too direct and simple. 

Hmm. Maybe the second quote is better. Alternatively, "Everything is possible with Photoshop!" but that's changing both "everything" and adding "possible". 

Alternatively, "Everything is vibrant!" where vibrant is a Photoshop keyword. 

Wait, perhaps I need to think of a different approach. Let me think again. 

The goal is to keep the original syntax and meter. "Everything is awesome!" has a certain rhythm. Changing two words to include the brand. 

Maybe "Photoshop: everything is vibrant!" 

Alternatively, "Your photos are awesome!" 

Wait, maybe the best is "Your vision is limitless!" but that's changing both. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop makes everything perfect!" 

Wait, perhaps the best option is to use "Your creations are limitless!" but that's two changes. 

Alternatively, let's think of the vocabulary replacements. 

The first idea was to replace "Everything" with "Your edits" and "awesome" with "perfect", resulting in "Your edits are perfect!" That's two word changes and keeps the structure. But does it convey delight? "Perfect" is good but maybe not as exciting as "awesome". 

Alternatively, replacing "awesome" with "epic": "Your edits are epic!" which is punchy. 

Alternatively, "Your vision is magical!" 

Hmm. Maybe "Your photos are magical!" 

Alternatively, using "limitless" to replace "awesome": "Everything is limitless!" But that's changing the second word. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop: everything is perfect!" 

Wait, maybe "Photoshop: everything is vibrant!" 

Alternatively, the structure allows inserting the brand. Maybe "Photoshop makes everything awesome!" but that adds a phrase and changes two words (replacing "everything" with "Photoshop makes everything"), which is more than two word changes. 

Hmm, this is tricky. The instruction says to change at most two words from the original. The original is "Everything is awesome!" 

So if I replace "Everything" with "Photoshop" → "Photoshop is awesome!" – one word change. That works, but is it effective? 

Alternatively, replacing "awesome" with "perfect" → "Everything is perfect!" 

Alternatively, combining both: "Photoshop is perfect!" but that's two words. 

Wait, maybe the best is to use "Photoshop: Everything is magical!" but that's inserting a colon and "magical" as a replacement. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop makes everything magical!" but that's more than two words. 

Hmm. Maybe I need to think of the remix step again. Let me go back. 

The user's final remix should include the brand name or keyword. Let me try to structure it as "Your vision is limitless with Photoshop!" but that's changing both replaceable parts and adding the brand. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop: every image is awesome!" – that's replacing "everything" with "every image" and keeping "awesome", then adding the brand. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop makes every image perfect!" 

Wait, perhaps "Your vision is limitless with Photoshop!" but the structure breakdown is key. 

Alternatively, since the original quote is "Everything is awesome!", changing "Everything" to "Your photos" and "awesome" to "limitless" gives "Your photos are limitless!" which doesn't make sense. 

Hmm, maybe "Your creativity is limitless!" using "creativity" instead of "everything" and "limitless" instead of "awesome". That works and keeps the structure. 

Alternatively, "Your edits are magical!" which is two words replaced. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop: everything is magical!" replacing "awesome" with "magical" and adding the brand. 

Wait, the structure step's explanation requires pointing out which words can be replaced. Let me proceed with the initial thought: 

In the structure breakdown, the replaceable parts are the first noun and the adjective. So "Everything" and "awesome" can be replaced. 

Possible replacements: 

1. "Your vision" and "limitless" → "Your vision is limitless!" (Why: emphasizes Photoshop's role in expanding creative potential, which is a brand strength.)

2. "Every project" and "perfect" → "Every project is perfect!" (Why: highlights the precision and outcome achievable with Photoshop.)

3. "Photoshop" and "magical" → "Photoshop is magical!" (Too simple, but direct. Maybe not the best.)

Alternatively, "Photoshop: every edit is perfect!" – but that adds the brand and changes two words. 

Alternatively, the user wants to end with punctuation, so maybe "Photoshop: your vision is limitless!" 

Hmm, maybe the best is "Your vision is limitless!" replacing both words. 

Alternatively, "Your photos are magical!" 

Alternatively, "Every project is vibrant with Photoshop!" but that's adding more words. 

Alright, proceeding to the remix step. 

Final remix: "Your vision is limitless!" with Photoshop implied, but to include the brand, perhaps: 

"Your vision is limitless with Photoshop!" but that's adding more words. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop: your vision is limitless!" 

Alternatively, the best option within two word changes is "Photoshop makes everything perfect!" but that's three words changed? 

Wait, "Everything is perfect!" would be replacing "awesome" with "perfect", so one word change. But then adding the brand name, so maybe "Photoshop: everything is perfect!" which is adding the brand at the beginning, keeping the structure. 

This way, the original quote is transformed into "Photoshop: everything is perfect!" which is one word change (awesome→perfect) and adding the brand name at the start. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop: your vision is limitless!" which replaces "everything" with "your vision" and "awesome" with "limitless", making two changes. 

I think the latter is better as it emphasizes the user's vision and ties it to Photoshop's capabilities. 

So the remix would be "Your vision is limitless with Photoshop!" but need to check the structure. 

Wait, the original structure was "Everything is awesome!" 

If I replace "Everything" with "Your vision" and "awesome" with "limitless", it becomes "Your vision is limitless!" without needing to add the brand. 

But to include the brand, perhaps "Photoshop: Your vision is limitless!" which adds the brand at the start. 

Alternatively, "Your vision is limitless with Photoshop!" – that includes the brand and uses the two word replacements. 

I think this fits better. 

Alternatively, maybe "Photoshop makes your vision limitless!" but that's changing more structure. 

Okay, I think that's a solid approach. Let me structure all steps accordingly.
