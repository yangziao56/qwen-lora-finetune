Okay, I need to come up with three quotes that match the Coca-Cola brand's goal of emphasizing safety and reliability. Let's see... The tone should be trustworthy.

First, maybe a classic saying. "The only way to do great work is to love what you do" by Steve Jobs. Wait, but that's more about passion than trust. Hmm. Maybe "Diamonds are forever" from De Beers? No, that's about durability. Or "Just Do It" from Nike—no, that's action-oriented. 

Wait, the user wants quotes that fit safety/reliability. Let's think of something like "Safety first" but that's a slogan already. Maybe a lyric? "You've got a friend in me" from the movie Toy Story. That's about trust. Or "You can't hurry love, no you can't rush love" but that's more about patience. 

Another option: "Trust in God, but keep your powder dry" by English proverb. But maybe too old. "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade" but that's about optimism. 

Wait, "The best things in life are free" by Haddaway. No, not exactly trust. 

Maybe "The right place at the right time" but not sure. Let me think again.

Ah, "Safety first" might be a good one. But it's a common phrase. The author would be unknown or a safety slogan. 

Alternatively, "Better safe than sorry" – that's a proverb, author unknown. That fits safety. 

Third quote could be "When you need someone you can count on, you need a friend" – but maybe that's too generic. 

Wait, maybe a lyric from a song. "You're my home" – but not sure. 

Alternatively, "I'll be there for you" from Friends. That's about reliability. 

Let me list three:

1. "Safety first" (unknown) because it directly relates to safety. 

2. "Better safe than sorry" (proverb) as it emphasizes cautious reliability. 

3. "You can count on me" (unknown) as it implies reliability.

Wait, but the user wants quotes, not proverbs. Maybe I should pick more famous quotes. Let me think again.

Maybe "The journey is the reward" by someone? Not sure. 

Alternatively, "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing" by Socrates. No, that's knowledge. 

Hmm, maybe "Diamonds are a girl's best friend" (Marilyn Monroe) but that's about valuables, not safety. 

Wait, perhaps "In times of stress, the best thing we can do for each other is to listen with compassion" – but that's more emotional support.

Wait, Coca-Cola's classic slogan is "Open Happiness". Maybe not relevant here. 

The persona goal is safety and reliability, so maybe "Trust the process" (unknown origin) but that's a common phrase. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the glue of life" – Stephen Covey. That could work. 

Wait, the user wants quotes, slang, lyrics, or popular expressions. 

So, possible options:

1. "Trust is the glue of life" by Stephen Covey. Because it directly states trust as a foundation, which aligns with reliability.

2. "Better safe than sorry" (proverb). Matches safety emphasis.

3. "When the going gets tough, the tough get going" – not reliability. Hmm. 

Alternatively, "A friend in need is a friend indeed" (proverb). Emphasizes reliable friendship. 

Wait, maybe "You can't go wrong with..." but that's incomplete. 

Alternatively, "Safety in numbers" – but that's a different angle. 

Alternatively, "You've got a friend in me" from the song "You've Got a Friend In Me" by Randy Newman (Toy Story). That's a lyric, and it's about trust and reliability. 

So maybe three quotes:

1. "Trust is the glue of life" by Stephen Covey. 

2. "You've got a friend in me" by Randy Newman. 

3. "Better safe than sorry" (proverb). 

Now, why each matches:

1. Stephen's quote directly ties trust to the foundation of relationships, so Coca-Cola as a trusted brand.

2. The lyric implies reliability and being there for someone, which can be linked to the brand's dependability.

3. The proverb emphasizes safety, so fits the safety aspect.

The best might be the first one because it's about trust, which is the persona. The lyric is also good. Let me check if these are correct.

Yes, "Trust is the glue of life" is from Stephen Covey's book. The lyric is correct. 

So step 1 would list these three. The best might be the first (★), but the lyric could also work. Let me decide which is better. Since the persona is Trust, the Stephen Covey quote is more on point. But the Coca-Cola brand's reliability might fit the "friend" idea. Hmm. Alternatively, "Better safe than sorry" is more about safety, which is part of the persona goal. 

Wait the persona goal is to emphasize safety OR reliability, so either could work. 

Probably the first quote (Stephen Covey) is best because it's directly about trust. Let me go with that as ★.
