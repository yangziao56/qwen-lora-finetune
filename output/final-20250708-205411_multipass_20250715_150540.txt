Okay, so I need to come up with three classic quotes that fit Coca-Cola's Joy persona. Let's think... Coca-Cola is all about happiness and celebration. The user wants quotes that evoke delight or excitement.

First quote that comes to mind is "Happiness is a warm puppy" by Richard Bach. Wait, but that's about puppies. Maybe not perfect, but the warmth and happiness vibe could work. The "warm" could tie into the drink's experience. 

Another thought: "Life is a party" by Tim McGraw's song. That's more about living it up, which aligns with Coke's party scenes. But the original lyric is "Life is a party, and parties aren't free." Hmm, maybe truncate it. 

Third idea: "Make every day a party" – but I'm not sure the author. Alternatively, "The best things in life are free" by Ross Parker. But that's about free things, whereas Coke costs money. Wait, maybe "The best things in life are free, but you can't get them for nothing." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "What's happiness without a soda?" – no, not a classic quote. 

Wait, maybe the Beatles' "All you need is love" – but that's more love-focused. 

Or maybe "Laughter is the best medicine" – but that's more about health. 

Wait, "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return." But again, love. 

Hmm, maybe "There's a time to laugh, a time to cry, a time to dance, a time to sing." From Ecclesiastes? Not sure. 

Wait, let's go back. The user wants quotes that fit the joy and excitement. The Tim McGraw lyric is popular and directly mentions a party, which Coca-Cola often associates with. So "Life is a party" from Tim McGraw could be good. 

Another classic is "Happiness is the best makeup" by Marilyn Monroe. That's about beauty and happiness. Could work, but the connection to Coca-Cola is a bit loose. 

Alternatively, "Happiness is like a glass of water" – no, that's not a real quote. 

Wait, maybe "Happiness is the best soap" – no. 

Wait, the first quote I thought of: "Happiness is a warm puppy" by Richard Bach. The idea is that simple pleasures bring joy. Coca-Cola could be that simple pleasure. 

Second, "Life is a party" from Tim McGraw. 

Third, maybe "The best things in life are free" – but that's more about things being free. Maybe not. 

Alternatively, "What's the world going to remember? Not the mistakes we made, but the fun we had." Not a classic quote. 

Hmm, maybe "Laughter is infectious" – but not a classic. 

Wait, "Happiness is a journey, not a destination." That's a common saying. Not sure the author. 

Alternatively, "Joy is the best beauty." Maybe. 

Wait, perhaps "Happiness is a butterfly, which, when pursued, is always just beyond your grasp, but which, if you will sit down quietly, may alight upon you." That's Thoreau, but too long. 

Alternatively, "Happiness is like a butterfly, which, when you follow it, it flies away, but, if you turn your eyes to other things, it comes back and sits on your shoulder." Also Thoreau. 

Hmm, maybe that's too complicated. 

Let me try again. The three quotes:

1. "Life is a party" (Tim McGraw) – directly links to celebration, which Coke uses in ads.

2. "Happiness is a warm puppy" (Richard Bach) – warmth and joy from simple things, which a Coca-Cola could symbolize.

3. "Laughter is the best medicine" (unknown, but common) – connects to joy, but maybe not as directly.

Wait, maybe the third one should be "What’s the world coming to when a drink of water is going to cost twenty dollars?" – but that's about price, not joy.

Alternatively, "Happiness is the best revenge" – not relevant.

Hmm. Let's pick the three:

1. "Life is a party" – Tim McGraw. Matches because it's about living joyfully and celebrating, which Coca-Cola is central to parties.

2. "Happiness is a warm puppy" – Richard Bach. The idea of simple, comforting joy that a Coca-Cola provides.

3. "The best things in life are free" – Ross Parker. Even though it mentions free, the sentiment of enjoying life's pleasures fits. Maybe Coke is part of those pleasures.

Now, which is the best? The Tim McGraw lyric seems most directly related to parties and celebration, which Coca-Cola often markets. The warm puppy is good but more about a pet. The Ross Parker one is about free things, which might not align. So the Tim one is better. 

So step 1 would be:

1. "Life is a party." — Tim McGraw ★ (because it directly evokes celebration and joy, key themes for Coca-Cola's branding.)
2. "Happiness is a warm puppy." — Richard Bach (links to simple, comforting joy, which Coca-Cola aims to provide.)
3. "The best things in life are free." — Ross Parker (highlights the value of enjoying life's pleasures, though less directly tied to Coca-Cola's product.)

Then step 2 would be breaking down the Tim McGraw quote.

Structure: "Life is a party." → |Life| is |a| party.| 

Wait, but the quote is "Life is a party." To make it adaptable for brand slogan, maybe structure as "Life is a [blank]." The "party" can be replaced with a Coca-Cola-related term. Wait, but the original quote's fixed part is "Life is a", so the variable part is the noun after. So structure: "Life is |a party|." 

So the editable part is "party" and the article "a". 

So to replace "party" with something like "Coca-Cola moment" or "Coca-Cola's joy".

Wait, but the user's step 2 says: "use | to separate editable and fixed parts. Point out which words can be replaced with brand keywords and why."

In the Tim McGraw quote: "Life is a party." The "a party" is the editable part. The fixed parts are "Life is". So structure: Life is |a party|. 

The replaceable words are "party" and maybe the article "a". The article can be kept as "a", but "party" can be replaced with something related to Coca-Cola. 

Possible replacements for "party": "Coca-Cola moment", "Coca-Cola buzz", "Coca-Cola joy", "Coke chill", etc. 

Step 3: Replacements. Let's think. 

Option 1: "Coca-Cola celebration". Because "Life is a Coca-Cola celebration." That keeps the structure and ties to celebration, which is a party theme. 

Option 2: "Coca-Cola buzz". But "buzz" is more about energy drinks? Not sure. 

Alternatively "Life is a Coca-Cola moment" – "moment" is a bit vague but works. 

So in replacements, suggest "Coca-Cola celebration" (since it directly ties to the party aspect) and "Coca-Cola joy" (highlighting the emotional state). 

Then step 4 would take the best replacement. "Coca-Cola celebration" sounds better, maybe. 

Final slogan: "Life is a Coca-Cola celebration." 

Wait, but "Life is a Coca-Cola celebration." Does that flow? The original was "Life is a party." So replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola celebration" adds the brand name. That's two changes? Wait, the original quote had "a party". So replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola celebration" would mean replacing the noun with a phrase that includes the brand. So that's one word replaced (party → Coca-Cola celebration?), but actually it's a longer phrase. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola" is added as an adjective, so maybe "Life is a Coca-Cola celebration." That's one replacement (party → Coca-Cola celebration). 

But the structure breakdown step should note that the "party" is the replaceable part, so replacing it with "Coca-Cola celebration" would be changing one word (party) into a phrase. But the instruction says "change at most two words from the original quote, including adding brand name". 

Original quote's "party" is one word. To replace with "Coca-Cola celebration" would be adding two words (Coca-Cola and celebration) replacing "party". So that's a net change of replacing 1 word with 3 words, but the constraint says at most two words changed. Wait, maybe the instruction allows adding the brand name as part of the replacement. 

Wait, the instruction says: "Point out which words can be replaced with brand keywords and why. ... Propose 1-2 replacement word/phrase sets with short reasons. Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So in the original quote, the editable part is "a party". So the words are "a" and "party". To replace "party" with "Coca-Cola celebration" would be changing "party" (one word) into "Coca-Cola celebration" (three words), but that counts as two changes? Or each added word counts as a change. 

Alternatively, perhaps the replacement should be simpler. Maybe "Coca-Cola joy" replacing "party" (one word replaced with two words: "Coca-Cola joy"). But adding "Coca-Cola" as part of the replacement counts as one change (replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola joy"), which is two words added, but the original was one word. So that would be a net increase of two words, but the instruction allows up to two changes. Wait, the instruction says "changing at most two words from the original quote". So replacing "party" (1 word) with "Coca-Cola joy" (two words) would be two changes (since each word counts as a change). So that's allowed. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola buzz" would be two words replacing "party" (one word). That's two changes, so okay. 

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coca-Cola party." Replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola party" adds the brand name as an adjective. So "Coca-Cola party" is two words replacing "party" (one word). That's a net change of one word added, so within the two-word limit. 

Wait, replacing "party" with "Coca-Cola party" would be adding "Coca-Cola" before the original word. So that's two words (Coca-Cola and party) replacing "party" (one word). That's an addition of one word. So it's within the two-word limit. 

Therefore, "Life is a Coca-Cola party." That's a valid replacement, keeping the structure. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola celebration." (two words replacing "party") which is allowed. 

The best option might be "Life is a Coca-Cola celebration." 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola moment." 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe "Life is a Coke celebration." Using "Coke" as the brand name. That's shorter and flows better. 

But the brand name is "Coca-Cola", but "Coke" is a common nickname. 

The user's brand is Coca-Cola, so better to use the full name. 

Alternatively, "Life is a Coca-Cola moment." 

So step 3 would have two options, then step 4 picks the best. 

Final slogan: "Life is a Coca-Cola celebration." 

That seems to fit. 

Now checking constraints: the slogan must not use first-person words. The example uses "Life is a...", which is neutral. Ends with period. Good. 

Okay, putting it all together.
