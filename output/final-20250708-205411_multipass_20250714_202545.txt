--- Pass 1 (valid) ---
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create a slogan for Coca-Cola emphasizing trust, safety, or reliability. The persona is about trust, so I need to find quotes that convey reliability.

First, Step 1: Quote Matching. Need three quotes that fit trust and Coca-Cola. Let me think. Maybe some common sayings or song lyrics. "Trust me, I'm from the government" is a joke, so probably not. Wait, the user mentioned "popular expression" so maybe common phrases. 

Hmm, "Safety in numbers" is a common saying. That's about safety, so maybe that works. But does it tie into Coca-Cola? Maybe if the slogan suggests that choosing Coke is a safe choice. 

Another thought: "You can't go wrong with..." like a classic saying. "You can't go wrong with a classic." That's about reliability. The author would be unknown, maybe. 

Then, "The greatest thing since sliced bread" is a common compliment. But how does that tie to trust? Maybe implying it's a reliable product. 

Wait, need to make sure each quote's author is noted. Let me think of three. 

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. This directly ties to reliability, so that's good. 

2. "Safety in numbers" – Popular expression. Suggests that choosing Coca-Cola is a safe choice. 

3. "The real thing" – Coca-Cola's own slogan, but maybe another source. Wait, no, "The Real Thing" is their own. But the user wants to remix a classic quote not their own. Maybe another one. 

Alternatively, maybe "Nothing beats a classic." But that's not a quote. 

Wait, maybe the Beatles lyric "In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "It's the real thing" is their slogan, but maybe use another. 

Wait, perhaps "When the going gets tough, the tough get going." Not exactly trust. 

Hmm. Let me pick three. 

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. Matches reliability as it implies that choosing Coke is a safe bet. 

2. "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Suggests that many choose Coke, so it's safe. 

3. "The best things in life are free." – Haskells. But that's about cost, not trust. Maybe not. 

Alternatively, "The proof of the pudding is in the eating." But too long. 

Wait, maybe "Trust me" from somewhere? 

Alternatively, "The devil you know" – but negative. 

Alternatively, "Better the devil you know." 

Hmm, perhaps "The proof is in the pudding" is better, but it's about quality. 

Alternatively, "The early bird gets the worm." Not related. 

Wait, "Nothing is as it seems" – but opposite. 

Alternatively, "All's well that ends well." Shakespeare. Maybe that's about reliability. 

Hmm. Let me go with the first three I thought of. 

First quote: "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. Explains why: directly links to reliability and safety in choosing a classic brand like Coke. 

Second: "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Suggests that choosing Coke is safe because many people do so. 

Third: "The greatest thing since sliced bread." – Popular expression. Emphasizes reliability and trust in the product's quality. 

Wait, but "The greatest thing since sliced bread" is more about being innovative, not trust. Maybe not the best. 

Alternatively, "Old habits die hard." – implies that people keep choosing it because it's reliable. 

Hmm. Maybe "The proof is in the pudding" could be better. 

Alternatively, "Actions speak louder than words." – about reliability. 

Wait, but the user wants to emphasize safety or reliability. So maybe "Safety in numbers" is better for safety, "You can't go wrong" for reliability. 

So the three quotes:

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. Matches because it directly ties to reliability, suggesting Coke is a safe choice. 

2. "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Matches by implying choosing a widely trusted brand (like Coke) is safe. 

3. "The real thing." – Coca-Cola slogan. But they want to remix an external quote. 

Hmm, maybe "The proof is in the pudding" is better. 

Wait, "The proof is in the pudding" means the results matter. So if you try it, you'll see it's reliable. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the glue." – Unknown. But not a classic quote. 

Alternatively, "Trust me, I'm a doctor." – Not relevant. 

Alternatively, "A rolling stone gathers no moss." Not related. 

Okay, maybe the three quotes are:

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. ★ Best because it directly links to reliability and safety in choosing a classic brand like Coke. 

2. "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Matches because it implies the safety in choosing a widely trusted product. 

3. "The real thing." – Coca-Cola's own slogan, but maybe not an external quote. So scratch that. 

Alternatively, "The early bird gets the worm" – no. 

Hmm, maybe "Better safe than sorry." – popular saying. Matches safety aspect. 

Alternatively, "Better safe than sorry." – author unknown. That's a good one for safety. 

So maybe the three quotes are:

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." (★)

2. "Better safe than sorry."

3. "Safety in numbers."

Then for each explanation:

1. Directly implies that choosing the classic (Coke) is a reliable decision. 

2. Encourages choosing safety (Coke) over risks, so ties to safety. 

3. Choosing Coke (part of the majority) is safe. 

So I'll go with those three. 

Now, for step 1, list the three with authors. 

First quote: "You can't go wrong with a classic." Author: Popular saying. 

Second: "Better safe than sorry." Author: Unknown, popular saying. 

Third: "Safety in numbers." Author: Popular saying. 

Then explanations. 

1. ★ Matches because it emphasizes reliability by referencing the classic nature of the brand. 

2. Matches safety aspect, suggesting choosing Coke avoids regret. 

3. Matches safety via popularity. 

Okay, that should work. 

Now proceed to structure breakdown with the best one, which is first. 

Then step 2: Structure breakdown. The best quote is "You can't go wrong with a classic." 

Breaking into parts: 

"You can't go wrong with a | classic." 

The editable part is "classic" and maybe "wrong" but probably the last word. Since the goal is to replace with brand keywords. 

The fixed parts are "You can't go wrong with a" and then the editable word. 

So the structure is "You can't go wrong with a | classic." 

The word to replace is "classic" with "Coca-Cola" or a keyword. 

Alternatively, maybe "You can't go wrong with a" plus the brand name. 

But the user says replace at most two words, including brand name. 

So replacing "classic" with "Coca-Cola" (but that's two words?) Wait, "Coca-Cola" is two words, but the original "classic" is one. 

Alternatively, maybe "You can't go wrong with a Coke." Since "Coke" is a shorter term. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

Wait, the original quote is "You can't go wrong with a classic." So the structure is "You can't go wrong with a [adjective]". 

So to fit the structure, replacing "classic" with "Coca-Cola" would make it "You can't go wrong with a Coca-Cola", but "a" is article. But "Coca-Cola" is a proper noun, so "a Coca-Cola" is okay. 

Alternatively, perhaps "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola" without the "a", but that changes the structure. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe "You can't go wrong with our classic." But that uses "our" which is not allowed. 

Wait, the user's important constraints: Do NOT use first-person words like I, we, me, etc. So "our" is bad. 

So the structure must be neutral. 

So keeping the structure as "You can't go wrong with a | classic." 

The replacement words would be "classic" to "Coca-Cola" but that's two words. Alternatively, "Coke" as a brand keyword. 

So "You can't go wrong with a Coke." That works. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." (without the "a") which would require changing "a" to nothing. But that's a structure change. 

Hmm. The user says to keep the syntax and meter, so changing "a classic" to "Coca-Cola" would have more syllables. Let me check syllables. 

Original: "You can't go wrong with a classic." 

Syllables: You (1) can't (1) go (1) wrong (1) with (1) a (1) clas-sic (2). Total 8? 

Coca-Cola is 3 syllables (Co-ca-Cola). So "a Coca-Cola" would be "a (1) Co-ca-Cola (3)" = 4 syllables vs "classic" (2). So the meter might be off. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coke." 

"Coke" is one syllable. So "You can't go wrong with Coke." That's shorter. 

Wait, but "a Coke" would be "a (1) Coke (1)" so total 2 syllables, same as "classic" (2). So "You can't go wrong with a Coke." 

That's the same structure. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with a Cola." But Cola isn't the brand name. 

Hmm, so replacing "classic" with "Coke" (as the nickname) would work better. 

Thus, the replacement is "Coke". 

Alternatively, maybe "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola's classic." But that's more words. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." without the "a" but then the structure changes. 

Hmm, perhaps the best is to use "Coke" as the replacement. 

Thus, the structure breakdown: 

Structure: You can't go wrong with a | classic. 

Editable part is "classic". 

Replacements: "Coke" or "Coca-Cola" (but need to check syllable count). 

Step 3: Vocabulary replacement. 

First option: Replace "classic" with "Coke". 

Reason: "Coke" is a well-known nickname for Coca-Cola, maintaining the original structure's rhythm. 

Second option: Replace "classic" with "Coca-Cola" but that requires changing "a" to nothing (since "Coca-Cola" is singular but doesn't take an article). 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's classic" but that's adding words. 

Hmm. So first option is better. 

Another possible replacement: "You can't go wrong with trust." But that might not tie directly. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." (removing the "a"), but that's a slight structure change. 

So step 3: 

Replacements: 

1. "Coke" – replaces "classic", fits syllables and brand recognition. 

2. "Coca-Cola" (with removing the article "a"), but that might disrupt the meter. 

The first is better. 

Step 4: Remix slogan. 

Using the first replacement: "You can't go wrong with a Coke." 

Does that fit the constraints? 

Yes: no first-person, includes brand (Coke), keeps structure. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." (without the "a") – but the original had "a". 

Wait, original quote was "You can't go wrong with a classic." So changing to "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola" would be changing "a classic" to "Coca-Cola". The article "a" is removed, so maybe that's acceptable. 

Let me check syllables: 

Original: You (1) can't (1) go (1) wrong (1) with (1) a (1) clas-sic (2) = 8 syllables. 

New: You (1) can't (1) go (1) wrong (1) with (1) Co-ca-Cola (3) = 7 syllables. 

Hmm, close enough. Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with a Coca-Cola." (adding "a" makes it 9 syllables). 

But maybe the user prefers to keep the structure as close as possible. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola's classic." But that's adding. 

Hmm, maybe the best is "You can't go wrong with a Coke." 

That keeps the article and structure. 

So final slogan: "You can't go wrong with a Coke." 

Alternatively, the user might prefer the full name. Let me see. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." (without "a") 

But which is better? 

The original structure has "a", so replacing "classic" with "Coca-Cola" would need to remove "a". 

But the user said to change at most two words. 

Original words: "a classic" (two words). To replace with "Coca-Cola" (two words). So replacing both "a" and "classic" with "Coca-Cola" would be two word changes. 

Wait, replacing "a classic" (two words) with "Coca-Cola" (two words). So that's acceptable under the "change at most two words" rule. 

Thus, replacing "a classic" → "Coca-Cola". 

The original: "You can't go wrong with a classic." 

New: "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

That changes two words: "a" and "classic" to "Coca-Cola". 

Yes, that works. 

So the final slogan would be "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

This way, keeping the original structure's meter: 

Original: 8 syllables (approx), new: 7, but close. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with a Coca-Cola." (9 syllables) but adds an article. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola's classic." But that's adding. 

Alternatively, the best is to replace "classic" with "Coca-Cola", removing "a". 

Thus, the slogan is "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

This meets all constraints. 

So putting it all together: 

Step 1's best quote is "You can't go wrong with a classic." 

Structure breakdown splits after "a". 

Replacement options are "Coca-Cola" replacing "classic" (with dropping "a") or "Coke". 

The final slogan would be "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

I think that's the best path. Let me confirm all steps again.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "You can’t go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. Matches by emphasizing reliability through the brand’s enduring reputation. ★  
2. "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Matches the idea of widespread trust in the brand.  
3. "Better safe than sorry." – Unknown. Matches the safety aspect of consistent quality.  

Structure: You can’t go wrong with a | classic.  
Replacements:  
1. "Coca-Cola" (replaces "classic" and removes "a" to preserve cadence; directly ties to brand name).  
2. "Coke" (replaces "classic" for brevity and brand recognition; maintains meter).  

Remix Slogan: "You can’t go wrong with Coca-Cola."

--- Pass 2 (valid) ---
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a slogan for Coca-Cola emphasizing trust, safety, or reliability. They need me to go through four steps, starting with Step 1.

First, I need to find three quotes that fit the trust theme. Let's brainstorm. Classic quotes about trust... Maybe "Trust me, I'm a doctor" but that's more about authority. Hmm. "Trust is the glue of life." That's a good one by Maya Angelou. She's well-known, and it directly mentions trust as a foundation, which aligns with reliability.

Another option could be from a song. "You've got a friend in me" from Toy Story. That's about loyalty and trust, so that's a good fit. The author is Randy Newman, I think. The message of being a reliable friend matches Coca-Cola's aim to be a trusted brand.

Third quote: Maybe a proverb? "A friend in need is a friend indeed." But that's more about true friendship. Alternatively, "The truth will set you free." Wait, that's more about honesty than trust. Maybe "You can't always get what you want, but you can get what you need." By The Rolling Stones. Not exactly trust, but about reliability in some way?

Wait, better pick another. Maybe "You can't go wrong with..." but that's more of a slogan itself. Let me think again. Maybe "You're safe with me" as a slang phrase. Author might be unknown, but it's commonly used to signify safety. That would pair well with Coca-Cola ensuring safety or reliability in their product.

So three quotes:

1. "Trust is the glue of life. It's the thing that holds all relationships together." Maya Angelou. This directly ties trust to foundational relationships, so fits the persona's goal of emphasizing reliability.

2. "You've got a friend in me." Randy Newman. The idea of being a trusted friend aligns with Coca-Cola being a reliable choice.

3. "You're safe with me." Slang. Straightforward about safety, which matches the persona's safety emphasis.

Now, decide which is the best. The Maya Angelou quote is strong and directly about trust, making it the best match. The others are good but maybe less directly about trust as a core value. So mark that one with ★.

Next step is structure breakdown for the best quote. Let me check the exact wording again. The quote is: "Trust is the glue of life. It's the thing that holds all relationships together." Hmm, but maybe I should take the first part only? Because the second sentence is an explanation. The user's step 2 says to separate editable and fixed parts with |. 

Wait, maybe the full quote is too long for a slogan. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to use the first sentence as the base. Let me confirm. The first part is "Trust is the glue of life." That's concise. So structure breakdown would be "Trust | is the glue of | life." Each part separated by |. The editable parts would be "Trust" and "life". Replacing "Trust" with the brand name and "life" with a keyword related to their product. Since Coca-Cola is a drink, maybe "every moment" or "every sip"? 

Wait, the persona's goal is to emphasize safety/reliability. So perhaps replacing "life" with something that represents the reliability aspect. But the structure breakdown requires pointing out which words can be replaced. Let me think again.

Alternatively, if the quote is "You've got a friend in me," the structure could be "You've got a | friend | in me." Replacing "friend" with "Coca-Cola" or similar. But the user wants to preserve rhythm. The third quote "You're safe with me" could be "You're | safe | with me." Replacing "safe" with "reliable" or "trusted"? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the quotes again. The first quote's first sentence is "Trust is the glue of life." The structure breakdown would be:

"Trust | is the glue of | life."

So editable parts are "Trust" and "life." To make it a Coca-Cola slogan, replacing "Trust" with the brand name and "life" with something like "every moment" or "your day." The fixed part "is the glue of" stays. Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola is the glue of life" but that's a bit odd. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola is the glue of every moment." Hmm, maybe not perfect. Alternatively, "Trust is the glue of life" with "Trust" replaced by "Coca-Cola" and "life" with "your refreshment" or something. Wait, but the brand's main product is drink, so perhaps "Coca-Cola is the glue of every sip." Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe "Coca-Cola is the glue of life" to imply that their product is essential, but maybe that's stretching it. Alternatively, "Safety is the glue of life" but that's changing the first word. Wait, the structure breakdown requires pointing out which words can be replaced. The first word "Trust" can be replaced with the brand name or a keyword, and "life" can be replaced with a product-related term. So maybe "Coca-Cola is the glue of every moment." That keeps the structure and meaning.

Alternatively, the second quote "You've got a friend in me" could become "You've got a Coca-Cola in me" but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe "You've got a friend in every Coca-Cola" but the structure breakdown would be "You've got a | friend | in me." So replacing "friend" with "Coca-Cola" would give "You've got a Coca-Cola in me," which isn't great. Alternatively, "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola" but that changes more than two words. Hmm.

The third quote "You're safe with me" could be "You're safe with Coca-Cola." That's a direct replacement of "me" with the brand. But the structure breakdown would be "You're | safe | with | me." So replacing "me" with "Coca-Cola" would give "You're safe with Coca-Cola." That's simple and meets the constraints. It emphasizes safety, which is the persona's goal. But is "safe" the best term here? Maybe "reliable" would be better for trust. Wait, the persona goal is safety OR reliability. The third quote is about safety, so that works.

So perhaps the third quote is better for Step 4. But I had marked the first quote as best. Hmm. Need to evaluate again.

The first quote is more about trust as a foundational element, but turning it into a slogan might require more adjustment. The third quote "You're safe with me" can be directly adapted to "You're safe with Coca-Cola." That's concise, meets the safety aspect, and uses the brand name properly. So maybe I should have chosen that as the best quote? Wait, in the initial Step 1, I chose the Maya Angelou quote as best because it's directly about trust. But maybe the third quote is more actionable for a slogan. The user's persona includes emphasizing safety OR reliability, so both are valid. 

Hmm, perhaps I need to re-examine my initial Step 1 choices. Let me see. The three quotes I listed were:

1. Maya Angelou quote: emphasizes trust as glue of life. Good for trust, but might need more work to fit the brand.

2. Randy Newman's "You've got a friend in me" – trust as friendship, but slogan adaptation may be tricky.

3. Slang "You're safe with me" – direct safety assurance, easy to adapt to brand name.

Given that the persona's goal is to emphasize safety OR reliability, the third quote might actually be the best match. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial Step 1 by marking the first quote as best. Because the third quote's message is more directly about safety, which is part of the persona's goal. The user wants to emphasize safety OR reliability, so both are acceptable, but the third quote is more straightforward for safety. Therefore, maybe the third quote is the better ★ choice.

I need to correct that. Let me adjust. 

Step 1 should list three quotes, with the best marked. So perhaps the third quote is better. Let me redo the Step 1 explanation:

1. "You're safe with me." (Slang) – Directly addresses safety, a key aspect of the persona's goal. ★

2. "Trust is the glue of life." Maya Angelou – Strong trust metaphor but requires more adaptation.

3. "You've got a friend in me." Randy Newman – Friendly reliability, but less direct on safety.

Then the best would be the third quote. That way, the slogan can be "You're safe with Coca-Cola," which is simple and fits.

Alternatively, the slang quote might not have an author, so maybe I need to pick another. Wait, "You're safe with me" is a common phrase, so author is unknown. That's acceptable.

Hmm, perhaps the user expects a well-known quote. Maybe "The customer is always right" but that's about service. Or "You can't go wrong with..." like "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." But that's more about choice than trust.

Alternatively, "Trust is the key" but not a famous quote.

Alternatively, "You're in good hands." Which is an insurance slogan, but maybe that's the source. The Allstate slogan "You're in good hands with Allstate." So maybe "You're in good hands with Coca-Cola." But that's a bit off-brand. 

Wait, but the user's Step 1 requires quotes, not existing slogans. So "You're in good hands" is from Allstate, so author would be the company. Maybe not ideal.

Back to my original three quotes. Let me proceed with the initial selection but adjust the best quote to the third one. Let me re-express Step 1 accordingly.

Wait, the user's instruction for Step 1 says to list three sentences (quote, slang, lyric, or popular expression). The third one is slang, so that's acceptable. 

Therefore, in Step 1, I should list:

1. "You're safe with me." (Slang) – Directly addresses safety, a key aspect of the persona's goal. ★

2. "Trust is the glue of life." Maya Angelou – Strong trust metaphor but requires more adaptation.

3. "You've got a friend in me." Randy Newman – Friendly reliability, but less direct on safety.

Then proceed with structure breakdown on the slang phrase.

Proceeding with that approach would lead to a better slogan. Let me proceed accordingly.
</think>

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. "You're safe with me." (Slang) – Directly addresses safety, a key aspect of the persona's goal. ★  
2. "Trust is the glue of life." Maya Angelou – Strength in trust as a foundational value, but less actionable.  
3. "You've got a friend in me." Randy Newman – Evokes reliability through companionship but lacks specificity.  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Structure: "You're | safe | with | me."  
Editable words: "safe" (to emphasize trustworthiness) and "me" (to replace with brand).  

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
Replacements:  
1. "reliable" + "Coca-Cola" → "You're reliable with Coca-Cola." → Fails rhythm, weak connection to safety.  
2. "safe" + "Coca-Cola" → "You're safe with Coca-Cola." → Keeps original cadence; clearly ties safety to the brand.  

Step 4【Remix Generation】  
Remix Slogan: "You're safe with Coca-Cola."

--- Pass 3 (valid) ---
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a slogan for Coca-Cola that emphasizes trust, safety, or reliability. They need to remix a classic quote, so first I need to find three quotes that fit the mood of trust. Let's see... 

Hmm, Coca-Cola is a trusted brand, so maybe quotes about reliability. "You can't go wrong with..." comes to mind. But who said that? Wait, the user might accept common phrases even if the author isn't known. Alternatively, maybe a song lyric. "You've got a friend in me" from the movie Toy Story. That's about trust. Or maybe a more classic quote. "Diamonds are forever" by Marilyn Monroe? No, that's more about permanence but not exactly trust.

Wait, "The best things in life are free" by Haskells? That's about value but maybe not trust. Let me think again. The quote "You can't go wrong with a classic" is a common phrase, maybe attributed to a saying rather than a specific author. Another one: "In times like these, you can count on..." Maybe from a song? "Always Coca-Cola" is their own slogan but that's not a quote. 

Wait, maybe "Trust in me" from a song like "The Trusting Game" by Simon & Garfunkel? Or "You can trust me on this" from somewhere. Alternatively, "When life gives you lemons..." but that's more about optimism. 

Alternatively, "A diamond is forever" by De Beers' slogan, but that's a slogan itself. Wait, the user wants a classic quote, slang, lyric, or popular expression. Let's list three. 

First quote: "Diamonds are forever" (Marilyn Monroe/De Beers). It's about permanence and trustworthiness. That could work for Coca-Cola as a reliable product. 

Second: "You can't go wrong with a classic" (unknown, common saying). The word "classic" ties into Coca-Cola being a classic drink, so that's good. 

Third: "In times like these, you can count on me" (maybe from a song like "Lean on Me" by Bill Withers? The actual lyric is "Lean on me, when the rain starts to pour...", but "count on me" is a line there). That's about reliability and trust. 

Now, why each matches:

1. "Diamonds are forever" by Marilyn Monroe/De Beers: emphasizes permanence and trust in lasting quality, which Coca-Cola can associate with their enduring reliability. 

2. "You can't go wrong with a classic" (unknown): "classic" reflects Coca-Cola's long-standing reputation, implying safety in choosing it. 

3. "You can count on me" from Bill Withers' "Lean on Me": directly speaks to reliability and trust, aligning with the persona goal. 

Which is the best? The third one is more directly about trust. The first is about permanence, which is related but maybe less direct. The second is about not making a wrong choice, which is about safety. The user's goal is to emphasize safety or reliability. "You can count on me" might be better for reliability. 

Wait, but the persona is trust, which includes reliability. The third quote is better. So mark the third one with ★. 

Wait, but "Lean on Me" is more about support, but "count on me" is about reliability. Maybe that's the best fit. 

Alright, Step 1 done. Now Step 2: Structure breakdown. The best quote is "You can count on me" from Bill Withers. Wait, but the user's example might need the full quote. Wait, actually, the user's instruction says "list 3 sentences (quote, slang, lyric, or popular expression)", so maybe I need the full line. The actual lyric from "Lean on Me" is "Lean on me, when the rain starts to fall...", but the line "you can count on me" is in there? Or is it from another song? Let me check. 

Hmm, "Lean on Me" by Bill Withers. The chorus is "Lean on me, on me, I'm on your side..." and "when the night has come and the land is dark, and the moon is the only light we'll see..." Maybe the exact line "you can count on me" isn't there, but the general message is. Alternatively, maybe the quote is from another source. Alternatively, maybe "You can always count on me" is a common phrase. Maybe I should use the lyric that's closest. Alternatively, the phrase "you can count on me" is a common expression. Maybe I should go with that as the quote, even if it's not a specific song lyric, but just a popular expression. 

Alternatively, another song: "You've Got a Friend" by Carole King: "You've got a friend" as the chorus. That's a line. 

Wait, perhaps "You've got a friend in me" is from the song by Randy Newman for Toy Story. That's "You've got a friend in me". That's a popular lyric. 

Hmm, "You've got a friend in me" might be better. Let me think. The user's goal is to emphasize safety or reliability. "You've got a friend in me" conveys trust and support. That could be good. 

Wait, maybe in Step 1, I should have included that. Let me adjust. 

So revising the three quotes:

1. "Diamonds are forever" by Marilyn Monroe/De Beers (as a slogan) – permanence, trust.

2. "You can't go wrong with a classic" (unknown) – implies safety in choice.

3. "You've got a friend in me" by Randy Newman (Toy Story song) – trust and reliability. 

Then, the third one is better. 

So the best quote would be ★ "You've got a friend in me" because it directly relates to trust and support. 

Wait, but the persona is for Coca-Cola, which is a product, not a person. So maybe "You've got a friend in every Coke" or something? Hmm, but the remix needs to fit the structure. 

Alternatively, "You can count on Coca-Cola" as a slogan, but the quote would be "You can count on me" from the lyric. 

Hmm, maybe the original quote should be "You've got a friend in me", which is third-person. 

Wait, let's proceed with the three quotes as:

1. "Diamonds are forever" – author Marilyn Monroe/De Beers. 

2. "You can't go wrong with a classic" – unknown. 

3. "You've got a friend in me" – Randy Newman (from "You've Got a Friend in Me" in Toy Story). 

Then the best is the third one because it's about friendship and trust, which aligns with the persona's goal. 

So in Step 1, I'll list those three. 

Now, proceeding to Step 2: Structure breakdown using the best quote (third one). 

Original quote: "You've got a friend in me". 

Need to break it into editable and fixed parts. 

The structure would be:

You've got a friend in | me | 

So, the parts that can be changed are "friend" and "me". 

"Why": "friend" can be replaced with a brand keyword like "partner" or "choice", but maybe "partner" isn't right. Alternatively, "friend" can stay, but "me" can be replaced with the brand name. 

Alternatively, "You've got a [brand keyword] in [brand name]". 

Wait, the goal is to emphasize safety/reliability. Maybe "You've got a trust in Coca-Cola". Hmm, but "trust" might not fit the lyric's flow. 

Alternatively, "You've got a partner in every Coke". Not sure. 

Wait, let's look at the structure. The original is "You've got a friend in me". The fixed parts might be "You've got a" and "in". The editable parts are "friend" and "me". 

So structure: You've got a | friend | in | me | 

Replace "friend" with something like "reliable choice" and "me" with "Coca-Cola". But "reliable choice" is two words. 

Wait, the user says to replace at most two words. 

Alternatively, keep "friend" and replace "me" with "Coca-Cola". 

Then the slogan would be "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola". That's good. 

Alternatively, replacing "friend" with "trust" and "me" with "Coca-Cola" would be "You've got a trust in Coca-Cola". Not as smooth. 

Alternatively, "You've got a friend in every bottle" (if the brand is the bottle). But the brand name is Coca-Cola. 

Hmm. So the best replacement might be keeping "friend" and replacing "me" with "Coca-Cola". 

Alternatively, maybe changing "friend" to "safety" but that might not flow. 

So in Step 2, the structure breakdown would be:

Structure: You've got a | friend | in | me | 

Replace "me" with "Coca-Cola" since that's the brand name. 

In Step 3: Replacements. 

Option 1: "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola". 

Reason: Replaces "me" with the brand name, maintaining the message of trust (friend) and reliability (Coca-Cola as the trusted entity). 

Alternatively, "You've got a reliable friend in Coca-Cola" but that's changing two words. The user allows up to two changes. Original quote has "friend" and "me". So replacing both would be allowed. 

Option 2: "You've got a partner in Coca-Cola". 

"Partner" instead of "friend" and "me" replaced. 

But "partner" might not be as strong as "friend". 

Alternatively, "You've got a classic in Coca-Cola", but that's less about trust. 

Hmm, the best option seems to be replacing "me" with "Coca-Cola" keeping "friend", so the slogan is "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola". 

So Step 3 would have that as one replacement. 

Step 4: The final slogan would then be "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola." 

That's within the constraints, ends with a period, uses the brand name, and doesn't use first-person. 

Wait, "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola" – the verb is "have got", which is okay. 

Alternatively, maybe "You've got a friend in every Coca-Cola" but that adds words. 

Alternatively, the original quote is "You've got a friend in me" so keeping the structure. 

Yes, the final slogan would be "You've got a friend in Coca-Cola." 

So putting it all together.

Slogan  : You can’t go wrong with Coca-Cola.
-----------------------------------------------
Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to create a slogan for Coca-Cola emphasizing trust, safety, or reliability. The persona is about trust, so I need to find quotes that convey reliability.

First, Step 1: Quote Matching. Need three quotes that fit trust and Coca-Cola. Let me think. Maybe some common sayings or song lyrics. "Trust me, I'm from the government" is a joke, so probably not. Wait, the user mentioned "popular expression" so maybe common phrases. 

Hmm, "Safety in numbers" is a common saying. That's about safety, so maybe that works. But does it tie into Coca-Cola? Maybe if the slogan suggests that choosing Coke is a safe choice. 

Another thought: "You can't go wrong with..." like a classic saying. "You can't go wrong with a classic." That's about reliability. The author would be unknown, maybe. 

Then, "The greatest thing since sliced bread" is a common compliment. But how does that tie to trust? Maybe implying it's a reliable product. 

Wait, need to make sure each quote's author is noted. Let me think of three. 

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. This directly ties to reliability, so that's good. 

2. "Safety in numbers" – Popular expression. Suggests that choosing Coca-Cola is a safe choice. 

3. "The real thing" – Coca-Cola's own slogan, but maybe another source. Wait, no, "The Real Thing" is their own. But the user wants to remix a classic quote not their own. Maybe another one. 

Alternatively, maybe "Nothing beats a classic." But that's not a quote. 

Wait, maybe the Beatles lyric "In the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make." Not sure. 

Alternatively, "It's the real thing" is their slogan, but maybe use another. 

Wait, perhaps "When the going gets tough, the tough get going." Not exactly trust. 

Hmm. Let me pick three. 

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. Matches reliability as it implies that choosing Coke is a safe bet. 

2. "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Suggests that many choose Coke, so it's safe. 

3. "The best things in life are free." – Haskells. But that's about cost, not trust. Maybe not. 

Alternatively, "The proof of the pudding is in the eating." But too long. 

Wait, maybe "Trust me" from somewhere? 

Alternatively, "The devil you know" – but negative. 

Alternatively, "Better the devil you know." 

Hmm, perhaps "The proof is in the pudding" is better, but it's about quality. 

Alternatively, "The early bird gets the worm." Not related. 

Wait, "Nothing is as it seems" – but opposite. 

Alternatively, "All's well that ends well." Shakespeare. Maybe that's about reliability. 

Hmm. Let me go with the first three I thought of. 

First quote: "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. Explains why: directly links to reliability and safety in choosing a classic brand like Coke. 

Second: "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Suggests that choosing Coke is safe because many people do so. 

Third: "The greatest thing since sliced bread." – Popular expression. Emphasizes reliability and trust in the product's quality. 

Wait, but "The greatest thing since sliced bread" is more about being innovative, not trust. Maybe not the best. 

Alternatively, "Old habits die hard." – implies that people keep choosing it because it's reliable. 

Hmm. Maybe "The proof is in the pudding" could be better. 

Alternatively, "Actions speak louder than words." – about reliability. 

Wait, but the user wants to emphasize safety or reliability. So maybe "Safety in numbers" is better for safety, "You can't go wrong" for reliability. 

So the three quotes:

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. Matches because it directly ties to reliability, suggesting Coke is a safe choice. 

2. "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Matches by implying choosing a widely trusted brand (like Coke) is safe. 

3. "The real thing." – Coca-Cola slogan. But they want to remix an external quote. 

Hmm, maybe "The proof is in the pudding" is better. 

Wait, "The proof is in the pudding" means the results matter. So if you try it, you'll see it's reliable. 

Alternatively, "Trust is the glue." – Unknown. But not a classic quote. 

Alternatively, "Trust me, I'm a doctor." – Not relevant. 

Alternatively, "A rolling stone gathers no moss." Not related. 

Okay, maybe the three quotes are:

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. ★ Best because it directly links to reliability and safety in choosing a classic brand like Coke. 

2. "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Matches because it implies the safety in choosing a widely trusted product. 

3. "The real thing." – Coca-Cola's own slogan, but maybe not an external quote. So scratch that. 

Alternatively, "The early bird gets the worm" – no. 

Hmm, maybe "Better safe than sorry." – popular saying. Matches safety aspect. 

Alternatively, "Better safe than sorry." – author unknown. That's a good one for safety. 

So maybe the three quotes are:

1. "You can't go wrong with a classic." (★)

2. "Better safe than sorry."

3. "Safety in numbers."

Then for each explanation:

1. Directly implies that choosing the classic (Coke) is a reliable decision. 

2. Encourages choosing safety (Coke) over risks, so ties to safety. 

3. Choosing Coke (part of the majority) is safe. 

So I'll go with those three. 

Now, for step 1, list the three with authors. 

First quote: "You can't go wrong with a classic." Author: Popular saying. 

Second: "Better safe than sorry." Author: Unknown, popular saying. 

Third: "Safety in numbers." Author: Popular saying. 

Then explanations. 

1. ★ Matches because it emphasizes reliability by referencing the classic nature of the brand. 

2. Matches safety aspect, suggesting choosing Coke avoids regret. 

3. Matches safety via popularity. 

Okay, that should work. 

Now proceed to structure breakdown with the best one, which is first. 

Then step 2: Structure breakdown. The best quote is "You can't go wrong with a classic." 

Breaking into parts: 

"You can't go wrong with a | classic." 

The editable part is "classic" and maybe "wrong" but probably the last word. Since the goal is to replace with brand keywords. 

The fixed parts are "You can't go wrong with a" and then the editable word. 

So the structure is "You can't go wrong with a | classic." 

The word to replace is "classic" with "Coca-Cola" or a keyword. 

Alternatively, maybe "You can't go wrong with a" plus the brand name. 

But the user says replace at most two words, including brand name. 

So replacing "classic" with "Coca-Cola" (but that's two words?) Wait, "Coca-Cola" is two words, but the original "classic" is one. 

Alternatively, maybe "You can't go wrong with a Coke." Since "Coke" is a shorter term. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

Wait, the original quote is "You can't go wrong with a classic." So the structure is "You can't go wrong with a [adjective]". 

So to fit the structure, replacing "classic" with "Coca-Cola" would make it "You can't go wrong with a Coca-Cola", but "a" is article. But "Coca-Cola" is a proper noun, so "a Coca-Cola" is okay. 

Alternatively, perhaps "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola" without the "a", but that changes the structure. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, maybe "You can't go wrong with our classic." But that uses "our" which is not allowed. 

Wait, the user's important constraints: Do NOT use first-person words like I, we, me, etc. So "our" is bad. 

So the structure must be neutral. 

So keeping the structure as "You can't go wrong with a | classic." 

The replacement words would be "classic" to "Coca-Cola" but that's two words. Alternatively, "Coke" as a brand keyword. 

So "You can't go wrong with a Coke." That works. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." (without the "a") which would require changing "a" to nothing. But that's a structure change. 

Hmm. The user says to keep the syntax and meter, so changing "a classic" to "Coca-Cola" would have more syllables. Let me check syllables. 

Original: "You can't go wrong with a classic." 

Syllables: You (1) can't (1) go (1) wrong (1) with (1) a (1) clas-sic (2). Total 8? 

Coca-Cola is 3 syllables (Co-ca-Cola). So "a Coca-Cola" would be "a (1) Co-ca-Cola (3)" = 4 syllables vs "classic" (2). So the meter might be off. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coke." 

"Coke" is one syllable. So "You can't go wrong with Coke." That's shorter. 

Wait, but "a Coke" would be "a (1) Coke (1)" so total 2 syllables, same as "classic" (2). So "You can't go wrong with a Coke." 

That's the same structure. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with a Cola." But Cola isn't the brand name. 

Hmm, so replacing "classic" with "Coke" (as the nickname) would work better. 

Thus, the replacement is "Coke". 

Alternatively, maybe "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola's classic." But that's more words. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." without the "a" but then the structure changes. 

Hmm, perhaps the best is to use "Coke" as the replacement. 

Thus, the structure breakdown: 

Structure: You can't go wrong with a | classic. 

Editable part is "classic". 

Replacements: "Coke" or "Coca-Cola" (but need to check syllable count). 

Step 3: Vocabulary replacement. 

First option: Replace "classic" with "Coke". 

Reason: "Coke" is a well-known nickname for Coca-Cola, maintaining the original structure's rhythm. 

Second option: Replace "classic" with "Coca-Cola" but that requires changing "a" to nothing (since "Coca-Cola" is singular but doesn't take an article). 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's classic" but that's adding words. 

Hmm. So first option is better. 

Another possible replacement: "You can't go wrong with trust." But that might not tie directly. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." (removing the "a"), but that's a slight structure change. 

So step 3: 

Replacements: 

1. "Coke" – replaces "classic", fits syllables and brand recognition. 

2. "Coca-Cola" (with removing the article "a"), but that might disrupt the meter. 

The first is better. 

Step 4: Remix slogan. 

Using the first replacement: "You can't go wrong with a Coke." 

Does that fit the constraints? 

Yes: no first-person, includes brand (Coke), keeps structure. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." (without the "a") – but the original had "a". 

Wait, original quote was "You can't go wrong with a classic." So changing to "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola" would be changing "a classic" to "Coca-Cola". The article "a" is removed, so maybe that's acceptable. 

Let me check syllables: 

Original: You (1) can't (1) go (1) wrong (1) with (1) a (1) clas-sic (2) = 8 syllables. 

New: You (1) can't (1) go (1) wrong (1) with (1) Co-ca-Cola (3) = 7 syllables. 

Hmm, close enough. Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with a Coca-Cola." (adding "a" makes it 9 syllables). 

But maybe the user prefers to keep the structure as close as possible. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola's classic." But that's adding. 

Hmm, maybe the best is "You can't go wrong with a Coke." 

That keeps the article and structure. 

So final slogan: "You can't go wrong with a Coke." 

Alternatively, the user might prefer the full name. Let me see. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." (without "a") 

But which is better? 

The original structure has "a", so replacing "classic" with "Coca-Cola" would need to remove "a". 

But the user said to change at most two words. 

Original words: "a classic" (two words). To replace with "Coca-Cola" (two words). So replacing both "a" and "classic" with "Coca-Cola" would be two word changes. 

Wait, replacing "a classic" (two words) with "Coca-Cola" (two words). So that's acceptable under the "change at most two words" rule. 

Thus, replacing "a classic" → "Coca-Cola". 

The original: "You can't go wrong with a classic." 

New: "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

That changes two words: "a" and "classic" to "Coca-Cola". 

Yes, that works. 

So the final slogan would be "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

This way, keeping the original structure's meter: 

Original: 8 syllables (approx), new: 7, but close. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with a Coca-Cola." (9 syllables) but adds an article. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola's classic." But that's adding. 

Alternatively, the best is to replace "classic" with "Coca-Cola", removing "a". 

Thus, the slogan is "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

This meets all constraints. 

So putting it all together: 

Step 1's best quote is "You can't go wrong with a classic." 

Structure breakdown splits after "a". 

Replacement options are "Coca-Cola" replacing "classic" (with dropping "a") or "Coke". 

The final slogan would be "You can't go wrong with Coca-Cola." 

I think that's the best path. Let me confirm all steps again.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "You can’t go wrong with a classic." – Popular saying. Matches by emphasizing reliability through the brand’s enduring reputation. ★  
2. "Safety in numbers." – Popular expression. Matches the idea of widespread trust in the brand.  
3. "Better safe than sorry." – Unknown. Matches the safety aspect of consistent quality.  

Structure: You can’t go wrong with a | classic.  
Replacements:  
1. "Coca-Cola" (replaces "classic" and removes "a" to preserve cadence; directly ties to brand name).  
2. "Coke" (replaces "classic" for brevity and brand recognition; maintains meter).  

Remix Slogan: "You can’t go wrong with Coca-Cola."
