Okay, I need to come up with three quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand with a pride tone, celebrating achievement or exclusivity. Let me think of some classic quotes related to pride or success.

First, maybe "The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing." But that's more about inaction, not sure. Wait, maybe not the best fit. Let me think again.

How about "Winning isn't everything, but wanting to win is." From Vince Lombardi? That's about achievement. But does it tie into exclusivity? Maybe not perfectly.

Wait, Coca-Cola often promotes happiness and togetherness, but the persona here is pride and exclusivity. Maybe a quote about being the best. Like "You're the top!" from "Born in the USA"? No, that's more patriotic. 

Alternatively, "We don't win, we dominate." From Mike Tyson? That's aggressive. Maybe too much.

Hmm. Maybe a lyric from a song. "I'm the king of the world!" from Titanic? That's about triumph and pride. But it's from the movie, not a song. But it's a popular expression. 

Another one: "The best things in life are free." But that's more about frugality. Not quite.

Wait, "Just do it." is a slogan, but Nike's. Not applicable here. 

Wait, "The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat." But that's from sports, maybe not.

Alternatively, "It's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game." Not about achievement.

Hmm, maybe "The greatest glory in living lies not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall." Nelson Mandela. But that's perseverance.

Wait, the user wants to celebrate achievement or exclusivity. Maybe "The world is yours." From Jay-Z? "Empire State of Mind"? That's about ownership and success. 

Or "I am the king." Elvis Presley? "A Little Less Conversation" lyrics. 

Alternatively, "You can't handle the truth!" from A Few Good Men, but that's more confrontational.

Wait, another thought: "I'm a survivor, I'm not gonna give up!" Survivor song. But that's about perseverance again.

Wait, the user wants exclusivity too. Maybe "Only the strong survive" by Meat Loaf. That's about exclusivity through strength. 

Or "We are the champions" by Queen. That's perfect for achievement. "We are the champions, my friends, and we'll keep carrying on..." That's definitely about celebrating victory and being champions. 

Another one: "I will survive." Gloria Gaynor. Also about triumph.

Third option: "Born to run." Bruce Springsteen. More about freedom but could be framed as achievement.

So for the three quotes:

1. "We are the champions, my friends" by Queen. Celebrates triumph and exclusivity as champions.

2. "I am the king" by Elvis Presley. Showcases individual pride and dominance.

3. "The world is yours" from Jay-Z. Suggests ownership and exclusivity.

Now, explaining each why:

First quote (Queen): Directly about being champions, so aligns with achievement.

Second (Elvis): Pride in being the top, but maybe too individualistic for Coca-Cola's communal brand.

Third (Jay-Z): "The world is yours" can tie to Coca-Cola's global presence and exclusivity of enjoying it worldwide.

Mark Queen's as the best ★ since it's more about collective achievement, which fits Coca-Cola's shared moments.
