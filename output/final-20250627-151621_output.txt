Output: Okay, the user wants me to create Coca-Cola slogans targeting the "Pride" persona. The key message should be about celebrating achievement or exclusivity. Let me start by thinking of classic poetry that deals with achievements or exclusivity. Maybe something from Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, or Oscar Wilde?

First, I need to break down what "Pride" means in a marketing context. People wanting to feel proud often seek validation of their status, achievements, or unique qualities. So the slogans should make the consumer feel like they're part of an exclusive group or that their choice reflects their success.

Let me think of some famous quotes or poems. Shakespeare's "All that glitters is not gold" comes to mind, but that's more about caution. Maybe "What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet." Hmm, not sure. "To be, or not to be: that is the question" – too philosophical.

Emily Dickinson's "Hope is the thing with feathers." Maybe not. Robert Frost? "The woods are lovely, deep and dark, but I have promises to keep." Not quite. Wait, "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I– I took the one less traveled by..." There's the aspect of exclusivity there, choosing a different path. That could work for Coca-Cola. So a slogan like "Take the Road Less Traveled. You Deserve a Coke." Using the original's theme but twisting it to exclusivity.

Oscar Wilde's "I can resist everything except temptation." Hmm, that's about indulgence. Maybe not achievement. "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." That's about uniqueness. Oh! "Be a Better You with Every Sip. Because You’re the Poet of Possibility." That uses his quote but changes it to exude self-pride. 

Another thought: Emily Dickinson's "We grow accustomed to the dark – When light is put away" but not sure. Maybe Robert Burns, "The best laid plans of mice and men often go awry." Not the right fit. 

Wait, Shakespeare's "The game's the thing" from Hamlet. "Make The Game Your Thing. Celebrate with a Coke." Not sure if that's the direction. 

What about "Better to Reign in Hell Than Serve in Heaven"? From Paradise Lost by John Milton. So "Better to Reign In Success Than Serve In Failure. Raise a Coke." 

Blake's "The Tyger." "Fierce Creatures Need The Fierce Sparkle Of Coke." Maybe that's a stretch. 

Poe's "The Raven." "Take a Coca-Cola with me – Nevermore!" Probably not. 

Tennyson: "Nature never did betray the heart that loved her." Slogan: "Your Life's a Beautiful Road – Make It Even Better With Coke!" 

Dickinson's "Success is counted sweetest by those who ne’er succeed." "Celebrate Your Victory With a Coke – They Taste Sweetest After Struggle." 

Walt Whitman's "I celebrate myself, and sing myself." So "Celebrate Yourself — The Coke of the Stronger Spirit." 

These examples are mixing the quotes with something that fits Coke's brand. Need to make sure they're catchy and convey pride, achievement, exclusivity. Also, Coca-Cola often uses "renewed," "sizzle," "refreshing," "fizz" in their slogans, so maybe incorporate those. 

Let me list the quotes and possible slogans again:

- "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I– I took the one less traveled by," by Frost → "Take The Road Less Travelled. You Deserve A Coke." (exclusivity)
- Oscar Wilde's "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken." → "Be Yourself: No One Else Is Sipping This Coke." (uniqueness)
- Paradise Lost "Better to Reign in Hell Than Serve in Heaven" → "Better To Reign In Success Than Serve In Failure. Raise A Coke." (achievement)
- Blake's "Fierce Creatures Need The Fierce Sparkle Of Coke." (perhaps from "Blake's Tiger" not sure)
- Poe's quote might not work well. 
- Tennyson's "Nature never did betray the heart that loved her." → "Your Life's A Beautiful Road – Make It Even Better With Coke! " (exclusivity and celebration)
- Emily Dickinson's "Success is counted sweetest by those who ne’er succeed." → “Celebrate your victory with a Coke – they never taste so sweet." (achievement)
- Whitman → "Celebrate Yourself — The Coke of The Stronger Spirit." 

Wait, Whitman's quote is "I celebrate myself and sing myself" so making that slogan "Celebrate Yourself — The Coke of The Stronger Spirit." Yeah, that works. 

Now, check for clarity and catchiness. Are the references too obscure? Need to balance poetic with accessibility. Maybe Frost's is well-known, so "Two roads diverged..." is probably familiar enough. The Whitman is classic and clear. The success line from Dickinson needs adjustment for flow. 

Pride is about self-esteem, so the slogans should empower the user. Make them feel special for choosing Coke. "Because You’re the Poet of Possibility." Using Wilde's quote's idea to make Coke part of their identity. 

Another Wilde approach: "I can resist everything except temptation." So "Can't Resist the Taste of Victory? Pour a Coke." 

Hmm, but the user specified achievement and exclusivity, so maybe emphasizing exclusivity as a choice. "Raise a Coke – The Beverage of Those Who Do." (inspired by "Better To Reign...") 

Putting it all together, the generated slogans should be a mix of references that resonate, are brief, and capture pride in one's achievements or belonging to an exclusive group. Need five examples. Let me check the ones I have and refine:

1. "Celebrate yourself — The Coke of the stronger spirit." (Whitman)
2. "Raise a Coke, you tiger of your own way." (Blake's Tiger)
3. "Better to reign in success than serve in failure. Raise a Coke." (Paradise Lost)
4. "Take the road less travelled—I did. I chose a Coke." (Frost) Wait, maybe "Take the road less travelled, I did, I chose a Coke." Not great. Better as "Take the Road Less Travelled. You Deserve A Coke." Slogan form. Semicolon? No, colons. Maybe comma. "Take the Road Less Travelled, You Deserve A Coke." 

Alternatively, "Take the road less travelled. You Deserve a Coke." Two sentences, more impactful.

5. “Celebrate your victory with a Coke – they taste sweetest after struggle." (Emily Dickinson)

Another one: "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one that sparkles. Raise a Coke." Hmm, adding the Coke element into the quote itself, maybe that's better. "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I… I took the one with soda in it. Raise a Coke." Maybe too humorous.

Alternatively, using the "I took the one less traveled by" and adding Coca-Cola as the reward: "I took the one less travelled by—Raise a Coke for achieving it."

Not sure. Maybe better to keep it simpler.

Final list maybe:

- "Celebrate yourself — The Coke of the stronger spirit." (Walt Whitman)
- "Raise a Coke, you tiger of your own way." (William Blake’s “The Tyger”)
- “Celebrate your victory with a Coke – they taste sweetest after struggle.” (Emily Dickinson)
- "Take the Road Less Travelled. You Deserve A Coke." (Robert Frost)
- "Better to reign in success than serve in failure. Raise a Coke." (John Milton’s Paradise Lost)

Check for readability and that the original lines are recognizable. "I'm the Tiger of my own way" from Blake's "What immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?" So personifying the Coke drinker as fierce and proud. The other lines are recognizable. These should hit the marks of achievement (victory, reign, celebrate) and exclusivity (road less traveled, tiger, 'I' who made the choice.)
</think>

Here are some Coca-Cola slogan remixes targeting the "Pride" persona, blending classic poetry with themes of achievement and exclusivity:  


| Slogan | Poetic Inspiration | Notes | 
|---|---|---|
| **Raise a Coke, you tiger of your own way**. *—William Blake* (ref. *The Tyger*) | “What immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry?” | Embrace fierce pride in forging your path. |
| **Celebrate your victories with a Coke They never taste so sweet after struggles**. *—Emily Brontë* (ref. *Wuthering Heights*) | “Success is counted sweetest, / By those who ne’er succeed.” | A ode to earned triumph, with just a sprinkle of poetic guilt. |

| **Celebrate yourself — the Coke of the stronger spirit**. *—Walt Whitman* (ref. *Song of Myself*) | “I celebrate myself, and sing myself” | Pride is owning your greatness. |
| **Take the road less traveled You deserve a Coke**. *—Robert Frost* (ref. *The Road Not Taken*) | “Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—I took the one less traveled by,” | Because Coke drinkers never followed the crowd. |

| **Better to reign in success than serve in failure Raise a Coke**. *—John Milton* (ref Paradise Lost) | “Better to reign in hell, than serve in heaven” | Victory is all about owning the throne. |

Let me know if you'd like to brainstorm more ideas!

Output: Alright, the user wants me to come up with some Coca-Cola slogans that target the "Anticipation" persona, focusing on sparking curiosity or suspense. Let me start by thinking about classic poetry. Maybe I can use quotes from famous poets, twist them a bit, and turn them into catchy slogans. 

First, I need to recall some classic lines. Wait, Edward Lear wrote "The Owl and the Pussycat." There's a line there about honey and sparrow grass. That's perfect for building anticipation. Just tweak it to include Coke.

Another thought: Robert Herrick has "To Daffodils." The lines "Fair Daffodils, we weep to see" could be adapted to something like a tear in the shape of a Coke bottle. That creates visual curiosity.

Emily Dickinson has "Hope is the thing with feathers." Changing that to "Coca-Cola is the thing in feathers" could work. But maybe that's stretching it too far. Need to keep the quote recognizable.

Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" has some suspenseful lines. The road less traveled and miles to go before sleep. Mixing those with taking a Coke break could add intrigue and make the reader wonder what will happen next.

John Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale" mentions a draught of vintage. Swapping that with a draught of Coca-Cola creates a connection with the poem but twists it into a product slogan about escaping the day.

Jane Taylor's poem "The Star" with its rhyme scheme could be adapted to a new stanza prompting people to stop and take a Coke break under a star.

Shakespeare's "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow" from Macbeth is all about delays and anticipation. Altering the lines about a tale told by an idiot to something about a future with Coke gives a twist to the famous quote.

The more I think, the better. Each of these twists needs to keep the original poetic feel but clearly link to Coca-Cola and spark curiosity or suspense. I should make sure the slogans are catchy and memorable while respecting the original poetry enough for people to recognize it. Alright, that's a good start. Time to put those ideas into slogan form.

Output: Okay, so I need to come up with some Coca-Cola slogans targeting the "Fear" persona, specifically to neutralize the fear of missing out or add urgency. Let me think about how I can use classic poetry to remix into these slogans.

First, what's the Fear persona about? It's the fear of missing out, so FOMO. People don't want to miss out on experiences, events, trends. Coca-Cola wants to be the solution here. So slogans should make them feel like by drinking Coke, they’re part of the cool crowd, or that it's urgent to act before they miss out.

Now, using classic poetry. Which poems can I take lines from and play with? Let me brainstorm some famous poems and see if any lines fit. 

Percy Bysshe Shelley's "Ozymandias" has "Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!" Maybe twist that to "Look on MY Coke, ye FOMO, and despair!" Not sure if despair is the right emotion here. Maybe "Look on MY Coke, and forget your FOMO!"

Emily Dickinson had a lot of short poems. Like "Success is counted sweetest / By those who ne'er succeed – / To comprehend a nectar Requires sorest need –". Maybe something like "Craving is counted sweetest / By those who ne'er succeed. / You just discovered the nectar, So come in, grab what you need!" 

Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken" has "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—"— maybe "Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— chose the one with the Coke, and that’s why I’m happy tonight and worry-free."

Walt Whitman's "I Hear America Singing" – line like "I hear the echoes of the earth." Maybe turn it into "I hear the echoes of the Earth. The drink they chose this time—Coke."

E.E. Cummings' poem "anyone lived in a pretty how town" — "they all laughed at first"— "They all laugh at first, when asked, 'Will you join in today?' Let your fear fade, your heart expand: here, Coke is part of the way!"

William Shakespeare's Sonnet 18: "Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?" So maybe "Shall I compare you to a summer’s day? You'd win, if you paired with Coke that day."

Hmm, maybe some others? Edgar Allan Poe's "The Raven": "Nevermore." Maybe "Never fear the 'no more,' if you choose Coke."

Wait, but the goal is to either neutralize FOMO or add urgency. Urgency might be pressing someone to act quickly, so "Don't wait, grab some now!" 

Let me try to pair poetry lines to FOMO. Another possibility: "The sun will come out tomorrow" (from Annie) could be a song, but maybe something like "Don’t miss the chance to taste the flavor of the sun today."

Wait, but need to specifically use poetry, not songs. Maybe "Hope is the thing with feathers" by Dickinson. "Hope is the thing with feathers. You’ve got it today with one can of Coke."

Hmm, not sure. Let me think again. For urgency, "Time will not come back." Something by Tennyson? "Time, like an ever rolling stream." 

Alternatively, "Time and tide wait for no man." That could be a classic saying. Maybe "Coke and summer days won’t slow and wait— enjoy before the tide turns later."

Another angle: Fear is the mind-killer (from Dune). But that's a book. Maybe "Fear is the mind-killer... and Coke is the thing that'll bring more— joy beyond the fear and the worry."

Not poetry but popular phrases. Need classic poetry. Let me check some others: "The world is too much with us" by Wordsworth. "The world is much too modern to miss out on Coke tonight."

Okay, perhaps:

1. "Look on my Coke, and forget fear of missing out." — from Shelley

2. "They all laugh at first, but Coke is the first to help— hurry now." — from Cummings

3. "Shall I fear missing out, or shall I choose the Coke?" —Shakespeare

4. "Time will not wait— neither will you. Grab your Coke and taste the taste you can't wait to get..." — paraphrase time poems

Hmm, maybe these could work. Let me try to formulate some more.

Alternatively, using "I wandered lonely as a cloud" from Wordsworth, changing "lonely" to "fearless": "I wandered fearless as a cloud, then saw a Coke—it soon brought me around."

Or "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways..." from Elizabeth Barrett Browning. "How do I want Coke? Let me count the ways. Before my fear of missing out steals today!"

Okay, perhaps these are variations. Need to make sure they fit the branding and are catchy. Also, need to check if the original poetry lines are well-known enough to make the remixed slogans recognizable but also clever. Alright, I'll go with some of these ideas and craft them into slogans.

They transform existential worries into opportunities to enjoy something simple + sweet (and fizzy). Perfect for a soda with "happiness" on its resume! 🍹

Output: Okay, I need to create a few Coca-Cola slogans that target the "Joy" persona. The user wants them to convey delight or excitement, and they want remixes of classic poetry. Hmm, first, what poems are well-known and have lines that can be twisted into a joyful theme? Maybe "Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll – that's a playful poem with a fun vibe. 

Wait, the user mentioned the slogan mixes should be poetry remixes. Let me think of poems that talk about joy, excitement, or positive emotions. "A Red, Red Rose" by Robert Burns? The famous "my love is like a red, red rose" part. That could work since "Coca-Cola Red" is part of their branding. 

Another classic, maybe "O Captain! My Captain!" by Walt Whitman? The opening line about joy and exultation. That fits since it's already about exultation and delirious joy. 

Emily Dickinson's poem "I heard a Fly buzz" has a line about "The eyes beside it / Had wrung them dry." But maybe that's not right. Wait, there's another line in her poem "Hope is the thing with feathers" – but that's more about hope. 

Oh, maybe "The Song of Hiawatha" by Longfellow. The line "Just for a handful of silver he left us, Just for a ribbon to stick in his coat" doesn't quite fit. Maybe "Sing Mother, sing to your boy again" from "Eve" by Lord Byron. 

Wait, another classic poet: Maya Angelou. Her work can inspire, like "Still I Rise," which starts with "You may write me down in history . . . " But how does that tie in? Maybe the idea of rising leads to joy?

Okay, need a few more. "If You Forget Me" by Neruda? "I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, topaz." Hmm, not sure. "How do I love thee?" by Elizabeth Barrett Browning: "I love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach." That could go, but maybe phrasing it differently with Coca-Cola's colors?

Let me start drafting. Take "Jabberwocky's" " 'Twas brillig, and the slithey toves" as the title, change the toves (which are like badgers) to "movers" for movement/excitement with Coca-Cola "delight." 

"Delight is the thing with feathers... / That bobs before your eye" from Dickinson's hope poem. 

Whitman's "O Joy and Victory! O Fatal Wonder!" can be "O Wonder and Delight" plus the rest leading to Coca-Cola. 

Burns' "Oh my Luve's like a red, red rose..." can switch Luve to "delight" and say "my joy is like a red, red Coke." 

Maya Angelou's "Still I rise" can become "Still you rise with Coca-Cola joy." 

Wait, ensuring that each slogan clearly ties in the joy and Coca-Cola, and using the poetry lines appropriately remixed. Also, check if each has "joy" or "delight" as per the prompt. Need to make sure the remixes are recognizable but still work for the brand. Got it. Time to write them out.
</think>

Here are some classic poetry remix ad slogans for Coca-Cola, leveraging their signature red color and joyful messaging. They’re playful, lyrical, and fun:

---

### 1. “Still I Rise... to a Red, Red Coke”  
*inspired by Maya Angelou*  
“I rise. I rise. I rise. Still delight’s my constant surprise. Joy to the world with every chime… *Coca-Cola* on this Christmas-time.”  

---

### 2. “O Joy, O Delight And Victory!”  
*remix of Walt Whitman*  
“O Wonder and Delight! O Fatal Surprise! Joy for this Hour! For Me, Delight, for This Day! *Coca-Cola* sings its triumphant hymn.”  

---

### 3. “Brillig with the Slighty Joy”  
*remix of Lewis Carroll*  
“O joy, joy, joy! O bliss! For the toves that *Coca-Cola* makes you miss. The joy that lifts your heart and lifts your toes, like only something *Coca-Cola* knows.”  

---

### 4. “A Red, Red Joy For You And Me”  
*swapped Robert Burns*  
“I never saw a joy, not one at all, that moved my heart like a *Coca-Cola* chill. *My Joy’s like a red, red Coke, that’s freshly sweet with delight.”  

---

### 5. “Hope is the Joy with Feathers”  
*modified Emily Dickinson*  
“Hope is the *Coke with feathers*—that perches in the soul. *Coca-Cola* sings, and sings, and sings—and never stops to *chill a soul*.”  

---  

These remixes lean into iconic verses to amplify Coca-Cola’s bold, joyful voice, while subtly nodding to their classic color and shared happiness. 🎉

Output: Alright, let's tackle this user's query. They want Coca-Cola slogans that target the "Trust" persona, emphasizing safety and reliability. So first, I should think about classic poetry that's associated with trust and dependability. The user mentioned remixing poetry, so I'll need to find poems that can be adapted into snappy ads.

Hmm, "The Road Not Taken" by Robert Frost comes to mind because of its reliability theme and decisiveness. "Take the road of trust" could blend well with Coca-Cola imagery. Then, maybe Emily Dickinson's "Hope is the thing with feathers" since she often wrote about hope and reliability. "Trust is the thing that keeps us believing" could work there.

Tennyson's "The Eagle" uses strength and might, so tying that to trust and reliability through "Soar with trust, drink with might" might resonate. Maya Angelou's "Still I Rise" is about resilience, so "We rise safe and strong" fits the need for reliability.

Robert Burns and his "My luve is like a red, red rose" – replacing "love" with "trust" and adding a twist with Coca-Cola's red color and trust. Plus, keeping it a classic feel.

Emily Brontë's "The stars are beautiful, bright and clear" allows emphasizing trust in a clear way. Lastly, Longfellow's "Footprints on the sand" can transform to trust steps with Coca-Cola.

Need to make sure each line feels natural, ties into safety and reliability, and has that poetic rhythm. Also, each slogan should clearly connect to Coca-Cola's product, using their color or imagery. Check the tone matches the trust persona, so it should feel dependable and reassuring. Maybe mix in some alliteration or rhyme for catchiness.
</think>

1. “Take the road of trust—its berries never die.” — *Adapted from* Robert Frost’s “The Road Not Taken” (trust as eternal reliability)  
2. “Trust is the thing that keeps us believing; And it never asks us to explain.” — *From* Emily Dickinson’s “Hope is the thing with feathers” (trust as quiet constancy)  
3. “Soar with trust, drink with might; And look with smiling eyes on Coca-Cola’s light.” — *Inspired by Alfred Lord Tennyson’s* “The Eagle” (trust as strength and clarity)  
4. “We rise safe and strong, never stooping to rest until safely in trust’s nest.” — *Reimagining Maya Angelou’s* “Still I Rise” (safety and trust as a guarantee)  
5. “Trust, O my love, is like a red, red rose, That’s poured in every Coca-Cola’s flow.” — *Play on Robert Burns’* “My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose” (trust as classic, timeless safety)  
6. “Trust glows in our soda; our promise true— The stars we hold are bright and clear for you.” — *Twisting Emily Brontë’s* “The stars are beautiful, bright and clear…” (trust as celestial reliability)  
7. “Trust leaves Coca-Cola’s footsteps in the sand.” — *Tweaked from Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s* “A Psalm of Life” (trust as steadfast tradition)

Output: So, the user wants me to create Coca-Cola slogans targeting the "Anticipation" persona, and they need to spark curiosity or suspense. They also want these to be remixes of classic poetry. Alright, first I need to think about classic poems that have a structure and a theme that can be easily adapted to fit the CocaCola brand. 

Starting with "Jabberwocky" by Lewis Carroll. The line "‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe" is famous for its nonsense words. To keep that style but switch to Coca-Cola, I need to replace words with things related to the brand. Maybe "Taste" instead of "brillig" and "fizzes" for "gyre and gimble". So that could work as "Twas tasty, and the fizzes did pour and chug in the cold."

Moving on to Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." He famously wrote, "Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow." To adapt this, I can keep the structure and replace the nouns and verbs. Changing "woods" to "Coke" and "snow" to "soda fountains". The result could be "Whose Coke these are I think I know. Her house is in the store though; She will not see me sipping here To watch her Cokes fill up with soda fountains."

Next, the anonymous poem "The Ants Go Marching" with "The ants go marching one by one, hurrah, hurrah...". The Coca-Cola version could be "The bubbles go floating one to one, hurray, hurray..."

Emily Dickinson's "Much Madness is divinest Sense" uses the lines: "Much Madness is divinest Sense – To a discerning Eye – Much Sense – the starkest Madness – 'Tis the Majority – In this, as all, prevail –". Changing some of the words here to fit: "Much Soda Madness is divinest Spark – To a fizzing Eye – Much Spark the starkest Soda Madness – 'Tis the Majority – In this, or any glass, prevail..."

Thomas Hood's "Oh What a Nice Jar" with "Oh what a nice shop, such a rare jar, and oh what a pity that it has just broken so far." So replacing shop with "what a nice Cottle" and jar with "glass", "Oh what a nice Cottle, such a rare glass, and oh what a pleasure that it just quenched my thirst like that."

Lewis Carroll's "How Doth The Little Crocodile" is next. The original is "...How cheerfully he seems to grin, How neatly spreads his claws, and welcomes little fishes in," So replacing crocodile and fishes. "How sparklingly the little Cottle seems to twinkle, How neatly spills its sweet goodness, and welcomes little quaffers in."

John Greenleaf Whittier's "The Barefoot Boy" has the line "When, baby-small, among the mint and mallows, grew the boy that by and by should be the chief..." So adapting that structure, maybe "When, soda-small, among the mint and mallows, grew the boy that by and by should be the chief of thirst..."

Robert Louis Stevenson's "The Bottle" with "The Bottle of wine, or the bottle of rum – Are the things on this earth that make the most fun; There is nothing like 'em, for the money ..." Changing wine to Coke: "There is nothing like this, for the price of a glass."

Charles Chestnutt's "The Cherry Song" goes "A chorus of voices at Christmas is singing: And our song we are bringing, we are bringing, we are bringing, To the children's good man." Changing "children's man" to "Cottle" and adding "sparkling": "A chorus of voices at Christmas is singing: And our song we are bringing, to the Cottle man, sparkling and thirst-quenching."

Paul Laurence Dunbar's "From Sunshine and Shadow" has "The frost has come and gone, The world looks gay and glad, And here is a new sun's day To make a winter glad." Changing frost to "fizz": "The fizz has come and gone, The bottle looks gay and glad, And here is a new sun's ray To make a world glad."

Sara Teasdale's "Barter" says "Make me a feast of strawberries and cream. I will give you a nightingale's song." So changing feast to Cottle, nightingale's song to "hum": "Make me a sip of Cottle and ice. I will give you a humming's song."

Finally, e.e. cummings' "in Just" has "the world is mud-luscious pue-bonky: glory, inJustice" so replacing glory with Coke's message: "the world is ice-luscious, fizz-bonky: coolness." 

I need to check if each slogan remix follows the original structure and retains the essence but adds the anticipation and curiosity. Since they are remixes, the structure must match closely. Also, ensuring that the synonyms used are related enough to the original poem's words but fit Coca-Cola's themes like sparkle, thirst quenching, cold, happiness, etc. Each poem's style is maintained. Anticipation is present by hinting at the reward (first sip of the Coke) through poems, which are inherently a bit mysterious and open-ended.

Output: Okay, the user wants Coca-Cola slogans targeting the "Fear" persona. They want to neutralize the fear of missing out or add urgency. Let me start by recalling classic poems that have lines which can be twisted into something fitting the theme.

First, I need to make sure I don't change the sentence structure and pattern. Just replace words with synonyms or like phrases. Let me think of some famous poems. Shakespeare's Sonnet 18? "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" That's a classic. Maybe change "thee" to "them" and add fear. Hmm, "Shall I compare them to a fear-some day?" Then replace the next part with Coca-Cola related lines.

Another one: Robert Frost's "The Road Not Taken"... "Two roads diverged in a wood..." Maybe change "roads" to "paths" and add urgency like "choose your thirst-taken path." Something along those lines.

Emily Dickinson's "Because I could not stop for Death..." Turning death into "fate" and Coca-Cola being the guest. "Because I could not stop for fate, He kindly stopped for me; The carriage held but three—" Us, Fate, and Coca-Cola. But wait, the user wants urgency or neutralize FOMO. Maybe "kindly wait with me" would add urgency. 

Percy Shelley's "Ozymandias" with "Look on my Works!" Wait, maybe twist that into "Look on my Coca-Cola glass! I scrawled it to be bold—" No, that may not fit. Let me try again.

T.S. Eliot's "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" with "Do I dare..." replacing dare with Coca-Cola. "Do I dare be bold? I too had always hoped. The next Coca-Cola is mine, I too am one..." That has urgency.

John Keats' "Ode to a Nightingale." Original line "Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!" Changing to Coca-Cola: "Thou wast not born for fear, immortal drink!" Then a line about courage.

Shelley's "Ode to the West Wind," "O, wind, if winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Maybe twist to fear: "My spirit blows with hope—I am alive! If panic comes, can Coca-Cola be far behind?" That adds urgency.

William Blake's "The Tyger" has "Did he who made the Lamb make thee?" So changing to Coca-Cola:"Did he who made the Lamb make this cold drink?" Maybe make it about courage.

John Donne's sermon, "Death, be Not Proud." Changing to FOMO: O FOMO, be not glad! Though many take thy bait, Coca-Cola's bold and cool—soon taste!"

Hmm, I need to make sure each poem's structure is kept. Also, replacing lines with key phrases. Let me check each again. For example, Dickinson's line becomes "Because I could not wait for fate, He kindly stopped for me; The carriage held but three—Us, Fate & Coca-Cola Bold." That keeps the structure with adjustments. Shelley's Ozymandias lines: "My name is Ozymandias, King Of Courage. Look upon my works..." Maybe "Look upon my works—My glass of Coca-Cola." 

Alright, I think these slogans can work. They mix the original poems with Coca-Cola themes and add urgency to counter fear. Need to make sure synonyms are spot-on and the message fits neutralizing FOMO or urgency. Let me tweak a bit more for clarity and punch.
</think>

1. **Coca-Cola: Neutralizing fear since 1886**  
*(Shakespeare’s Sonnet 18 remix)*  
Shall I compare them to a fear-some day?  
Thou are more bold. Temperate and fair!  
Weary summer’s heat can cause us to chide;  
Beware the cold drink of November, bare.  
Leaves shall outlive us, then die too.  
Thou art a joy against time’s tide.  
Nor shall Death brag thou art afraid  
When in eternal rest we fade—  
As Coca-Cola never grows old,  
Nor ever is seen when it spills its bold.  

---  

2. **Coca-Cola: Bold when the rest are fleeing**  
*(Robert Frost’s *The Road Not Taken* remix)*  
Two paths diverged in a wood, and I—  
I took the one more rushed to buy;  
Though as for that, the other was bold  
And it’s fair to say it was the thirst-taking one.  
Because it was there. And cool.  
Coca-Cola made it less cold.  
And though it be fair that I took the easier path,  
It’s all in a rush: I dare them to wait.  

---  

3. **Coca-Cola: Courage with every sip**  
*(Emily Dickinson’s *Because I could not stop for Death* remix)*  
Because I could not wait for fate, He kindly stopped for me;  
The carriage held but three—Us, Fate & Coca-Cola Bold.  

---  

4. **Coca-Cola: Fear comes first but never lasts**  
*(Percy Shelley’s *Ozymandias* remix)*  
My name is Ozymandias, King Of Courage.  
Look on my works—My glass of Coca-Cola—and despair.  

---  

5. **Coca-Cola: When panic strikes, you’re never alone**  
*(W.H. Auden’s *September 1, 1939* remix)*  
For love goes slowly where it’s always gone.  
Yet here my Coca-Cola pours like rain.  
Calm and cool… but not for long.  

---  

6. **Coca-Cola: Don’t look back in fear**  
*(T.S. Eliot’s *The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock* remix)*  
Do I dare be bold? I too had always hoped.  
The next Coca-Cola is mine, I too am one…  
Climb on to the chaise of courage:  
I shall be telling this with a gentle sip;  
I don’t think that you’ll have a sip to spare…  

---  

7. **Coca-Cola: Make memories before they slip away**  
*(John Keats’s *Ode to a Nightingale* remix)*  
Thou wast not born for fear, immortal Drink!  
Nor wilt thou ever die, but softly sip;  
Thou drinkest for ever of thy cool embrace…  
I still am bold… I still will kiss my lips.

8. **Coca-Cola: Don’t be the one we leave behind**  
*(Percy Shelley’s *Ode to the West Wind* remix)*  
O, wind, if winter comes, can spring be far behind?  
My spirit blows with hope—I am alive!  
The next Coca-Cola will outstrip you by a chalice…  
I would, in other words, be brave, or bold—in short, be wise.  

---  

9. **Coca-Cola: Fear fades… but memories last forever**  
*(Benjamin Pope’s *The Rape of the Lock* remix)*  
Let us first solemnly address our fears, that, they may have their due.  
“Since you do not disdain to have a name among those you left behind, let us know what fears survive, and what Coca-Cola has in store for those who wait.”  

---  

10. **Coca-Cola: Not scared? Then we’re ready to take on the world.**  
*(William Blake’s *The Tyger* remix)*  
“Could he who has seen dread in the dark of the mind  
Make thy fearless, bold, shining, eye?”  

---  

11. **Coca-Cola: Courage is always bold, never bitter**  
*(John Donne’s *Death be Not Proud* remix)*  
O FOMO, be not glad! Though many take thy bait, Coca-Cola’s bold and cool—soon taste!  
We fear thee not, Coca-Cola!  

---  

12. **Coca-Cola: Fear’s got nothing on us. (And we’re ready for you.)**  
*(Lord Byron’s *The Destruction of Sennacherib* remix)*  
The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,  
And his cohorts were slain, but we boldly did drink.  
For the Coca-Cola is strong, strong, strong.

Output: Okay, the user wants Coca-Cola slogans based on classic poetry. The target is the "Joy" persona, emphasizing delight and excitement. I need to take well-known poetry lines and substitute words to match Coca-Cola themes.

First, "Charge all thy griefs on me," from The Tempest. Replace "Charge" with "Mix", "griefs" with "sorrows", and "me" with "Coca-Cola". That becomes "Mix all thy sorrows on Coca-Cola". Works for a Coke boosting happiness.

"Blow, blow, thou winter wind," from As You Like It. Changing "Blow" to "Bubbles", "winter" to "joy, and "thou" to "thou blithe spirit". Wait, maybe "Blow, blow, thou blithe spirit, thou Coca-Cola, and fill the house with joy." Hmm, that might not flow. Need to make it snappier.

"Thou silver bark, which care or art" – from The Tempest. Replace "silver bark" with "bubbling cup" and "care or art" with "not art could cast." So, "Thou bubbling cup, which care or not art could cast," – Maybe "Thou bubbling cup, which care or not art cold, But then thou must be cold." Not sure. Let me adjust to focus on joy.

"Swell'st with the east," from The Tempest. Replace "east" with "joy". "Thy bubbling cup, which care or not, Doth force thee to swell with pure joy." That's better.

Looking at "A little drop of joy did ever dawn upon that sun and us," from The Tempest. Change "drop of joy" to "drop of soda" and "dawn" to "spark". "A tiny drop of soda did ever dawn Upon that joy and us." Maybe tweak: "A tiny drop of soda did ever dawn Upon the joy and us, to cheer us evermore."

"Sweet are the uses of adversity," from As You Like It. Replace "adversity" with "Coca-Cola". "Sweet are the uses of Coca-Cola To us that live at home; But the world is wide, And the wild world," – Wait, might need to shorten it. "Sweet are the uses of Coca-Cola To us that live at home, to cheer our every day."

"Good night, good night! parting is such sweet sorrow," from Romeo and Juliet. Swap "parting is such sweet sorrow" to "joy is such sweet joy". "Good night, good night! Joy is such sweet sorrow, That I shall say good night till it be morrow." 

"Pity me not, nor weigh me not down," from the poem, replace with "Coca-Cola not" and "sorrows not". "Pity me not, nor weigh me not down With sorrow, but, with Coca-Cola, make my heart light."

"Blow, blow, thy wintry wind, thou winter wind," from As You Like It. Change "winter wind" to "joy and joyous sprite". Maybe "Blow, blow, thou joy and joyous sprite, thou winter wind, and swell with joy and mirthful delight"

"All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players; they have their exits and entrances," from As You Like It. Replace "stage" with "soda-flavored playground" and "exits" with "refreshments" and "entertainers. "All the world’s a soda-flavored playground, and all the men and women merely players and entertainers; they have their refreshments and entertainments, and one man in his time plays many parts,". But that's too long. Maybe trim to "All the world’s a soda-flavored playground, where we pour delight and cheer, and all the men and women merely players."

"A little more than kin, and less than kind," from Hamlet. Change to "A little more than joy, and more than cold," – "Clever's our kin, and less than kind, but drink of Coca-Cola, and the world is thine." Hmm, okay.

"O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!" from Hamlet. Switch to Coca-Cola's effects. "O what a joy and drink divine is I! Come, let me make your day with us; let me pour my heart into you, let me pour the Coca-Cola in you."

"Blow, blow, thou winter blight, thou Coca-Cola, and fill the house with joy!" – might need to make more Coca-Cola specific.

Overall, I need to ensure each slogan keeps the original structure, substitutes words to Coca-Cola themes, and conveys joy with excitement. Check each line's rhythm and make sure synonyms fit. Let's review the final ones to ensure clarity and impact.
