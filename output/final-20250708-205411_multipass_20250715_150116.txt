Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to come up with a slogan for Coca-Cola using the persona of Joy, aiming to evoke delight or excitement. They provided a structured process to follow. Starting with Step 1, I need to list three quotes that fit the mood.

First, I should think of quotes related to happiness, excitement, or joy. The quote needs to be something well-known so the remix makes sense. Let's see... Maybe "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken" by Oscar Wilde? Hmm, but that's more about individuality. Not sure if it fits the brand.

Wait, Coca-Cola is all about sharing happiness. Maybe a song lyric? "Happy together" comes to mind. The Turtles had a song "Happy Together." That's a classic. That could work because it's about shared joy, which ties into Coca-Cola's branding.

Another option: "Life is a party" by Beyoncé. That's about living joyfully, which aligns with the brand. The third quote could be something like "Here's to the crazy ones" from Apple's "Think Different" campaign, but that's more about innovation. Maybe "Life is short, and there's no time to drink bad wine" by Sofia Coppola? No, not exactly right.

Wait, maybe a holiday classic like "Joy to the world"? But that's more seasonal. The user specified "joy" but not necessarily holiday. Let me think again. "Turn up the volume" or something energetic? Maybe "Just do it" but that's Nike. Hmm.

Alternatively, "Happiness is the best makeup" – not sure. Let me go back. The Turtles' "Happy Together" is good. "Happy Together" as a song is upbeat and about togetherness, which Coca-Cola promotes. That's a strong candidate.

Second quote: "The best things in life are free, but you have to buy the others." That's a saying. But maybe not the best fit. Alternatively, "Life is a cabaret, old chum" from Cabaret, but that's more dark. Maybe "Make every day a party" – but that's not a quote.

Wait, the user wants a quote, slang, lyric, or popular expression. Let me think of another lyric. "Don't worry, be happy" by Bobby McFerrin? That's perfect. It's about embracing happiness, which is the persona's goal. So "Don't worry, be happy" by Bobby McFerrin. That's a good match because it directly encourages joy.

Third option: "What's love got to do with it?" by Bonnie Tyler. No, not exactly. Maybe "Laughter is the best medicine," but that's a saying. Let me pick three solid ones.

So first quote: "Happy Together" by The Turtles. Why? It's a joyful, upbeat song about shared happiness, fitting Coca-Cola's communal aspect.

Second quote: "Don't worry, be happy" by Bobby McFerrin. Encourages joy and positivity, aligning with the brand's uplifting message.

Third quote: "Life is a party" by Beyoncé. Promotes living life joyfully, which matches the persona's goal. Now, which is the best? The Turtles' song might be more timeless and associated with happiness in groups, which Coca-Cola often markets. But "Don't worry, be happy" is more direct. Hmm. I think "Happy Together" is better for the structure, but let me see the requirements. The structure breakdown needs to separate parts. Maybe "Happy Together" can be adapted to "Happy Together, Coke" or something. 

Alternatively, "Don't worry, be happy" could become "Don't worry, be Coke." Wait, that might not make sense. Maybe "Don't worry, just Coke." Hmm. "Happy Together" can be "Happy Together, [Coca-Cola]" but need to fit. Let me check the exact lyrics. The line is "Happy together, you make me so happy, happy together." Maybe the structure can be split as "Happy Together" with a replacement. 

Alternatively, "Life is a cabaret" from "Cabaret" is "Life is a cabaret, old chum," but that's more about embracing life's chaos, not exactly joy. 

Hmm. Let me confirm. The user wants the quotes to match the mood of Joy and the brand. The three options I have are:

1. "Happy Together" by The Turtles – fits togetherness and joy.
2. "Don't worry, be happy" by Bobby McFerrin – direct advice to be joyful.
3. "Life is a party" by Beyoncé – emphasizes living joyfully.

Now, explaining why each matches:

1. The Turtles' "Happy Together" directly evokes shared joy and happiness, aligning with Coca-Cola's communal branding. ★ (maybe)
2. "Don't worry, be happy" encourages positivity, which Coca-Cola's ads often use to suggest their product brings happiness.
3. "Life is a party" suggests constant celebration, which Coca-Cola can be part of.

I think the first is best because it's about being together, which Coca-Cola markets as a shared experience. So mark that as ★. Then structure breakdown would split "Happy Together" into parts. But maybe the structure needs a different approach. Alternatively, "Don't worry, be happy" can be split into "Don't worry, be ___." So replacing "happy" with "Coca-Cola" but that might not fit. Wait, the structure step requires to separate fixed and editable parts. 

Alternatively, if using "Happy Together" as the quote, the structure might be "Happy Together | (fixed)" but need to see. Let me proceed. 

Now, Step 2 would involve breaking down the chosen quote. Let me proceed with "Happy Together" as the best match. 

Wait, but the user might prefer "Don't worry, be happy" because it's more of a slogan itself. Hmm. Need to decide which is better. The user's persona is Joy, so any of these would work. The "Happy Together" is better for a communal slogan. 

Alright, I'll proceed with those three quotes, mark the first as ★. Now proceed to structure breakdown with the best quote.
