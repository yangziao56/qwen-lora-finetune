Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to be a copywriter remixing a quote for Coca-Cola with the persona of joy and the goal to evoke delight. Alright, starting with Step 1: Quote Matching. Need three classic quotes that fit joy and Coca-Cola.

First thought: Coca-Cola is often associated with happiness, sharing moments, and refreshment. Maybe a quote about joy and togetherness. The Beatles song "All You Need Is Love" comes to mind, but that's love, not exactly the same. Maybe "Laughter is the best medicine"? Hmm, author is Elbert Hubbard. But how does that tie to Coca-Cola?

Another possibility: "Happiness is a warm puppy." From Steve Martin? Wait, no, that's from him, but puppies aren't directly related to the brand. Wait, maybe a Coca-Cola commercial tagline? But the user wants a classic quote from a non-brand source. 

How about "Life is better with Coke"? No, that's a slogan. Let's think of another quote. "Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light." That's Dumbledore, but too specific. 

Wait, maybe "You can’t stop the wave, but you can learn to surf." Not really joy. Maybe something about joy and sharing. 

Ah, "The best things in life are free, but you have to buy some of them." Not sure. 

Wait, "The best things in life are free" by The Beatles. That's a song lyric. It's about love and companionship being free, but the second part could be adjusted. That might work. So first quote: "The best things in life are free," by The Beatles. Why? Because Coca-Cola is often seen as a treat that enhances life's moments, so "the best things" could include a Coke. 

Second quote: "Happiness is like a butterfly; the more you chase it, the more it eludes you." By Nathaniel Hawthorne. Hmm, maybe not exactly positive. 

Alternatively, "Laughter is infectious." Maybe not famous enough. 

Wait, there's a quote by Confucius: "Wherever you go, go with all your heart." Not directly. 

Wait, "Happiness is the best makeup." Not sure. 

Hmm, another possibility: "The greatest happiness is to know that you are loved." Maybe too personal. 

Wait, maybe "The greatest wealth is health." No, not joy. 

Back to the Beatles. Another song: "All you need is love." But again, that's love. 

Wait, maybe "What a wonderful world" from Louis Armstrong's song. Lyrics: "I see trees of green, red roses too..." The line "I think to myself, what a wonderful world." So the quote could be "What a wonderful world." That's positive, and Coca-Cola's tagline used to be "Open happiness," so connecting to the world being wonderful with a Coke. Author: Louis Armstrong. Why? Because it evokes a joyful, positive outlook aligned with Coca-Cola's brand.

Third option: "Happiness is a journey, not a destination." by Ralph Waldo Emerson. Maybe. But why? Because Coca-Cola is part of the journey's moments. 

Alternatively, "Happiness is the highest form of health." by Dalai Lama. Not sure. 

Wait, maybe "Happiness is like a sunbeam, no two are ever alike." Not famous enough. 

Hmm. Let's list the three I have so far:

1. "The best things in life are free" - The Beatles. Matches because Coca-Cola is affordable and part of life's joys.

2. "What a wonderful world" - Louis Armstrong. Matches because it's about the positivity that Coca-Cola aims to enhance.

3. "Laughter is the best medicine" - Elbert Hubbard. Matches as joy and humor, which Coca-Cola can symbolize.

Now, which is the best? Maybe the first one, because it can be easily adapted. But need to choose which one is best. The Beatles' quote is classic and well-known. Let's see:

For the ★, maybe "The best things in life are free" since "free" can be replaced with a brand keyword. Alternatively, "What a wonderful world" could be adapted with "Coca-Cola" making the world wonderful. 

Alternatively, "Laughter is the best medicine" could have "Coca-Cola" as the medicine? Probably not. So the first two are better. Let's go with "What a wonderful world" as the best because it's more directly about the world's joy, which Coca-Cola could embody. So:

Quotes:

1. "The best things in life are free." — The Beatles. Why: Emphasizes life's simple joys, aligning with Coca-Cola's role in affordable, joyful moments. ★

Wait, maybe that's the best because it's more famous and the replacement can work. Let me think again. The quote "What a wonderful world" is a song lyric, so that's valid. The author is Louis Armstrong, since he popularized the song. 

Alternatively, the original lyrics were by Bob Thiele and George David Weiss, but Armstrong is the main associated artist. 

Hmm. Let's finalize:

Step 1:

1. "The best things in life are free." — The Beatles. Why: Highlights simple joys like Coca-Cola, which is affordable yet uplifting. ★

2. "What a wonderful world" — Louis Armstrong. Why: Evokes a joyful, vibrant existence enhanced by Coca-Cola moments.

3. "Laughter is the best medicine." — Elbert Hubbard. Why: Connects Coca-Cola to the joy that lifts spirits.

Okay, that works. Now, proceeding to structure breakdown for the ★ one.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "The best things in life are free." — The Beatles. Why: Highlights simple joys like Coca-Cola, which is affordable yet uplifting. ★  
2. "What a wonderful world." — Louis Armstrong. Why: Evokes a joyful, vibrant existence enhanced by Coca-Cola moments.  
3. "Laughter is the best medicine." — Elbert Hubbard. Why: Connects Coca-Cola to the joy that lifts spirits.  

Structure:  
The best things in life are | free |.  

The fixed phrase is "The best things in life are", and the editable word is "free". Replace "free" with a Coca-Cola-related keyword because it emphasizes what Coca-Cola offers (e.g., refreshing, joyful moments) as a counterpoint to "free".  

Replacements:  
1. "Coca-Cola" — "The best things in life are Coca-Cola." (Direct brand insertion, but awkward phrasing.)  
2. "Coke" — "The best things in life are Coke." (Simpler and preserves rhythm.)  

Remix slogan: "The best things in life are Coke."
