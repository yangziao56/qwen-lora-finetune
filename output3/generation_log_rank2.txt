--- Generation for Photoshop | Fear ---
Token count: 5985

Okay, so the user wants me to create a headline for Photoshop that addresses fear of missing out or adds urgency. Let's start with Step 1: Quote Matching. They need three classic quotes that fit the persona (fear) and brand (Photoshop). Each quote should be 5-10 words and have an author.

First, I need to think of quotes related to fear, missing out, or urgency. Maybe something like "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." That's FDR, and it's about overcoming fear, which could tie into Photoshop helping people not fear missing out. But does it fit the brand? Maybe, but it's more general.

Another option: "The early bird catches the worm." That's Benjamin Franklin. It's about acting quickly, urgency. Photoshop could be the tool you need to use early to not miss out on opportunities in design. That's a possibility.

Then, "What's past is prologue." Shakespeare from The Tempest. It suggests that the past leads to the future. Maybe not as direct, but if we twist it to say that past mistakes (like not using Photoshop) are the start of something better. Hmm, maybe not the best.

Wait, maybe "Nothing is certain but death and taxes." Benjamin Franklin. But that's too negative and not about fear of missing out. Not good.

Alternatively, "The first step is always the hardest." Unknown. It's about starting, which Photoshop could make easier, reducing fear. But not directly about urgency.

Wait, "The best things in life are free." Not sure. Maybe "Carpe diem" from Horace, "Seize the day." That's about urgency and not missing opportunities. Perfect. Author is Horace. "Seize the day" is short, 3 words. But the requirement is 5-10 words. Maybe expand it to "Carpe diem: seize the day, for tomorrow never comes." But too long. Maybe just "Seize the day." But need 5-10 words. Maybe the full quote: "Seize the day, for tomorrow never comes." That's 7 words. Author: Horace.

Alternatively, "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." Eleanor Roosevelt. Maybe, but not directly urgency.

Alternatively, "Haste makes waste." But opposite of urgency. 

Wait, "He who hesitates is lost." Benjamin Disraeli. That's about urgency, hesitation leading to missing out. 6 words. Author: Benjamin Disraeli. 

That's better. So maybe that's one. 

Third quote? Maybe "There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it." Kahlil Gibran. Not sure. 

Hmm, maybe "Time and tide wait for no man." George Herbert. Classic, about urgency. 7 words. 

So compiling three:

1. "The first step is always the hardest." (Unknown) – but maybe not urgency enough.

Wait let's list the top three:

Option 1: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." (FDR). It's about overcoming fear, which ties to neutralizing fear of missing out. The persona is fear, so this directly addresses fear.

Option 2: "He who hesitates is lost." (Benjamin Disraeli) – about urgency, not hesitating which leads to loss. Perfect for urgency aspect.

Option 3: "Time and tide wait for no man." (George Herbert) – emphasizes urgency, time passing.

Now explain each why they fit:

1. FDR's quote addresses fear directly, suggesting that fear itself is the main obstacle, so Photoshop could help overcome that fear by making editing easy, thus neutralizing fear of missing out on creating great images.

2. Disraeli's quote about hesitation leading to being lost (missing opportunities) fits urgency. Photoshop can help you act without hesitation, ensuring you don't miss out on opportunities to create.

3. Herbert's quote about time passing without waiting, so you need to act now with Photoshop to avoid missing out on time-sensitive projects.

Which is the best? The user wants to neutralize fear of missing out or add urgency. The Disraeli quote is better for urgency (hesitating means missing out). FDR's addresses fear itself. The Herbert quote is more general urgency. Maybe Disraeli's is the best, so mark it with ★.

So step 1 would list these three quotes, with the second as best.

Moving on to structure breakdown. Let's pick the best quote: "He who hesitates is lost." by Benjamin Disraeli. Need to split into editable and fixed parts.

Original quote: "He who hesitates is lost." 

Structure breakdown: "He who hesitates | is lost." Here, "hesitates" and "lost" are the editable parts. "He who" and "is" are fixed. Wait, maybe "He who" is fixed, then "hesitates" can be replaced with Photoshop-related action, and "lost" could be replaced with something about missing out or urgency.

Alternatively, split into "He who | hesitates | is | lost." Maybe each word is a part. The key is to see which words can be swapped with brand keywords. "Hesitates" is the action, so maybe replacing "hesitates" with "delays" or "waits". "Lost" could be replaced with "miss out" or "fall behind".

Wait, the goal is to include the brand, so maybe the brand name replaces one word, and another keyword. Since we can replace up to two words. So perhaps replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates to use Photoshop" but that's too long. Maybe "Photoshop" replaces "He who"? Not likely. Maybe "hesitates" can be replaced with "delays using Photoshop", but that's adding words.

Alternatively, structure breakdown as:

"He who | hesitates | is | lost."

The first part is fixed, the second "hesitates" can be replaced with an action involving Photoshop, then "lost" can be replaced with the consequence. Since we can only change two words, maybe replace "hesitates" with "waits" and "lost" with "misses out".

But need to keep original structure. Alternatively, replace "hesitates" with "hesitates to edit" and "lost" with "behind".

Wait the key is to keep the structure. Let's think of possible replacements.

For example, "He who hesitates (to use Photoshop) is lost (to competitors)." But need to fit the structure.

Alternatively, using "Photoshop" in place of "he who". Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe "The user who hesitates is [lost opportunity]." Hmm, but structure is important.

Alternatively, the original quote is a common phrase, so replacing "hesitates" with a verb related to Photoshop, like "delays editing" and "lost" with "misses the mark".

But need to keep it concise. Let's think of possible replacements.

Replacements: 

Option 1: "hesitates" -> "delays editing" (Photoshop's action) and "lost" -> "misses out". But "delays editing is misses out" doesn't make sense. Maybe "He who delays editing is lost to creativity." Not sure.

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to edit is [missing out]." 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to Photoshop is lost in the crowd." Hmm, but maybe not.

Alternatively, replacing "lost" with "outdone". "He who hesitates is outdone."

Wait, maybe "He who hesitates to innovate is lost." But need to include brand.

Alternatively, using "Photoshop" as a verb? Not common. Maybe "He who waits to Photoshop is lost."

Hmm, tricky. Let me think of the possible word replacements.

The best approach might be to replace "hesitates" with "waits" and "lost" with "misses out". So "He who waits is misses out." Wait, but structure. Maybe "He who hesitates to Photoshop is lost." But "hesitates to Photoshop" might not be natural. 

Alternatively, using "delays using Photoshop" instead of "hesitates". But that's adding words. Maybe structure breakdown as:

Original quote: "He who hesitates | is lost."

Editable parts: "hesitates" and "lost". 

So possible replacements:

1. "He who hesitates to edit is lost in the crowd." 

2. "He who waits is outdone by Photoshop." Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe the key is to have the brand name inserted. For example, "He who hesitates to use Photoshop is lost." That replaces "hesitates" with "hesitates to use Photoshop" but that's changing one word (adding phrases). Since the user said "limit to changing at most two words, including brand name." So replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates to Photoshop" but that's not a verb. Alternatively, "He who Photoshop hesitates is lost." Doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the verb can be "edits", but not sure.

Wait maybe "He who hesitates is [Photoshopped out]." Not good.

Hmm. Maybe the best approach is to use "He who hesitates is [behind]." then "Photoshop keeps you ahead." But not sure.

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to Photoshop is behind." So replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates to Photoshop" (adding brand name as a noun here, but used as a verb?) Not standard. Maybe better to use "He who hesitates with Photoshop is lost." Hmm.

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to edit is lost." And add Photoshop as the brand. Maybe "Photoshop: He who hesitates to edit is lost." But the structure requires keeping the original syntax. 

Alternatively, maybe structure is:

Original: "He who hesitates is lost."

Breaking into "He who hesitates | is lost."

Replace "hesitates" with "waits" and "lost" with "misses the mark". So "He who waits is misses the mark." Not quite. 

Alternatively, replace "lost" with "missing out." So "He who hesitates is missing out."

Then the remix headline could be "He who hesitates is missing out on Photoshop." But not sure if that fits. Alternatively, "He who hesitates is lost without Photoshop."

Hmm. Alternatively, "He who hesitates to Photoshop is lost." Even if "Photoshop" as a verb is not standard, it's a known term. Maybe acceptable for a headline. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates is out of the loop with Photoshop." 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to edit is lost in the photo crowd." 

Wait, perhaps the best is to take the quote and insert the brand. Let's see the final remix:

Original quote: "He who hesitates is lost." 

If we replace "lost" with "out of the loop", and add Photoshop as the solution: "He who hesitates to Photoshop is out of the loop."

Wait but "hesitates to Photoshop" might not be right. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to edit is lost. Photoshop keeps you ahead." Not one line. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to perfect their photos is lost." Then brand as Photoshop helps. But the headline should include the brand name.

Hmm, perhaps the best is to use "He who hesitates to Photoshop is lost." Even if the verb is a stretch. Because "Photoshop" can be used as a verb meaning to edit with the software. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to edit is lost. Photoshop makes it easy." But that's two sentences. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates is lost. Photoshop ensures you don't." Not sure.

Alternatively, structure breakdown: the original quote's key parts are "hesitates" and "lost". We can replace "hesitates" with "waits" and "lost" with "outdone by Photoshop". So "He who waits is outdone by Photoshop." But that might not capture the urgency properly.

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to edit is lost. Photoshop keeps you sharp." 

Wait maybe the best is to replace "lost" with "behind" and include Photoshop as the solution: "He who hesitates is behind. Photoshop leads the way." Not one line. 

Hmm, perhaps the user's example can help. Let me think of an example. The user's instruction says the final headline should be one line, keep original syntax, include brand name, end with punctuation.

Original quote: "He who hesitates is lost."

If we can replace "hesitates" with "waits to Photoshop" and "lost" with "outdone" then: "He who waits to Photoshop is outdone." But not sure about "waits to Photoshop".

Alternatively, "He who hesitates without Photoshop is lost." 

Or "He who hesitates to use Photoshop is lost." That might work. 

Yes, that seems better. "He who hesitates to use Photoshop is lost." It keeps the original structure, replaces "hesitates" with "hesitates to use Photoshop", adding the brand name as part of the verb phrase, which counts as one word change? Wait, replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates to use Photoshop" would be adding three words, but the user said change at most two words, including brand name. Wait, the limit is changing at most two words, where adding the brand counts as a change. So, in the original quote, the key words are "hesitates" and "lost". 

If we replace "hesitates" with "hesitates to Photoshop" (adding "Photoshop"), that's two changes? Or "Photoshop" is one word added. Let me see:

Original: "He who hesitates is lost."

Replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates to Photoshop" (inserting "Photoshop" as the object of the verb "hesitates to"), so the verb becomes "hesitates to Photoshop", which might be a bit awkward but acceptable in a headline. The total changes would be adding "Photoshop" (one word) and changing the structure, but the user allows replacing two words. Wait, maybe "hesitates" is replaced by "hesitates to use Photoshop", but that's adding three words. That's over the limit. 

Alternatively, replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates with Photoshop" but that's unclear. 

Hmm. Maybe the best way is to replace "lost" with "missing out" and insert Photoshop as the brand in another part. 

Wait, perhaps the structure breakdown allows inserting the brand in the fixed parts. Let me re-examine step 2.

Structure breakdown: copy the quote and use | to separate editable and fixed parts. 

Original quote: "He who hesitates is lost."

If we break it as "He who | hesitates | is | lost." Then, the editable parts are "hesitates" and "lost".

So, replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates to Photoshop" (adding brand name), but that's a bit forced. 

Alternatively, replace "lost" with "outdone by Photoshop". But that would be two words changed (lost -> outdone by Photoshop), which is two words but that's adding two words. 

Wait the instruction says "change at most two words from the original quote". Each word counted individually. So original words are: He, who, hesitates, is, lost.

Replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates with" and "lost" with "Photoshop's help". No, that's more changes.

Alternatively, replace "hesitates" with "waits" and "lost" with "Photoshop-free". So "He who waits is Photoshop-free." Not making sense.

Alternatively, "He who hesitates is out of Photoshop." Meaning you're not using it and thus lost. 

Hmm, maybe the best is to go with "He who hesitates is lost without Photoshop." 

In that case, replacing "lost" with "lost without Photoshop", but that adds three words. 

Wait, original quote has "is lost", so "lost" is one word. To replace "lost" with "lost without Photoshop" would be replacing one word with four words, which is too much. 

Alternatively, maybe just changing "hesitates" to "hesitates to Photoshop" (one word addition), and keeping "lost", but that's one change. Then the headline would be "He who hesitates to Photoshop is lost." 

The verb "hesitates to Photoshop" uses "Photoshop" as a noun with the preposition, meaning to edit using Photoshop. It's a bit of a stretch but acceptable for a headline. 

Alternatively, use "He who hesitates to edit is lost. Photoshop helps." But that's two lines. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to edit with Photoshop is lost." That's adding two words: "with Photoshop", which might count as two changes (since "hesitates to edit" was original "hesitates"). So original "hesitates" is replaced by "hesitates to edit with Photoshop", which is more than two changes. 

Hmm, this is challenging. Maybe I should think differently. Let me go back to step 2 and see.

Step 2: Structure Breakdown. The user's example might help. 

Wait, let's try a different approach. Let's pick the first quote again, maybe FDR's. 

Wait, perhaps the best quote is actually "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." But no, too long.

Alternatively, the quote "Carpe diem" is too short. 

Wait, maybe the quote "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." (FDR). 

Let me see:

Step 1 quote options:

1. "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Franklin D. Roosevelt. 

Matching reason: Directly addresses fear, suggesting that overcoming fear (of missing out) is key. Photoshop helps reduce that fear by making editing achievable, so users don't fear missing out.

2. "He who hesitates is lost." Benjamin Disraeli. 

Matching: Urgency; not hesitating to use Photoshop ensures you don't miss opportunities.

3. "Time and tide wait for no man." George Herbert. 

Matching: Urgency of time, implying you need Photoshop to act quickly and not miss out on timely projects.

Marking the best as ★ "He who hesitates is lost." because it directly ties to urgency and missing opportunities, which is the persona's fear.

But maybe FDR's quote is better for "fear" aspect. 

Wait the persona's goal is to neutralize fear of missing out (FOMO) or add urgency. So FDR's quote addresses the fear itself, so maybe that's better. Let me re-evaluate:

If the best quote is FDR's, then the structure would be different. Let's try that.

Original quote: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." 

Step 2 structure breakdown: 

"The only thing we have to fear | is fear itself."

The editable parts could be "fear" (the first instance) and "fear itself". 

Wait, to fit the brand (Photoshop), perhaps replacing "fear" with something related to Photoshop. 

But it's tricky. Let's see.

Possible replacement: "The only thing you have to fear is not using Photoshop." 

Changing "we have to" to "you have to", and replacing "fear itself" with "not using Photoshop". 

That would be changing "fear itself" to "not using Photoshop" (two words changed? Or "fear itself" is two words, so replacing both). 

Alternatively, "The only thing we have to fear is missing out on Photoshop." 

Hmm. Let me think.

Alternatively, the original quote is 11 words. The user requires 5-10 words. "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." is 10 words. So that's okay.

Replacing "fear" (second instance) with "fear of missing out". 

"The only thing we have to fear is fear of missing out. Photoshop removes it." Not one line. 

Alternatively, "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop." (replacing "fear itself" with "not using Photoshop"). 

That would be: "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop."

Keeping the structure as "The only thing [to fear] is [not using Photoshop]."

Original quote: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

Breaking into: "The only thing we have to | fear | is | fear itself."

Editable parts: "fear" (the first instance?) and "fear itself".

Replace "fear itself" with "fear of missing out" → but that's more words. 

Alternatively, "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop." 

This changes "we have to fear is fear itself" to "to fear is not using Photoshop". 

That's keeping the structure but replacing the second "fear" with "not using Photoshop".

This could work. 

So the remix headline could be "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop."

Which is concise, keeps the original structure (though slightly altered to third person), and includes the brand.

But in the user's instructions, they say to speak from a neutral or second/third person perspective, not first. So using "we" is not allowed. So changing "we have to" to "you have to" or omit.

Original quote: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

To make it third person, perhaps "The only thing to fear is fear itself." (removing "we have to").

Then replacing "fear itself" with "not using Photoshop."

So final headline: "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop."

This is better. It fits the constraint, keeps the original syntax, includes the brand, and addresses the fear of missing out (by implying that not using Photoshop is the real fear).

But maybe the user's initial choice of quotes would prefer the Disraeli one for urgency. 

Hmm, perhaps the first approach with the FDR quote is better because it directly addresses the fear aspect. 

So perhaps I should go with that. Let me proceed with that path.

Step 1:

1. "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Franklin D. Roosevelt. Matches as it directly addresses fear, suggesting Photoshop neutralizes FOMO by overcoming the fear itself.

2. "He who hesitates is lost." Benjamin Disraeli. Matches urgency, not hesitating ensures you don't miss opportunities with Photoshop.

3. "Time and tide wait for no man." George Herbert. Matches urgency of time, implying Photoshop is essential to act now.

★ The first quote is better because it directly tackles the fear component, which is the persona's core.

Proceeding to Step 2 with FDR's quote.

Structure breakdown:

Original quote: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."

To make it third person: "The only thing to fear is fear itself." (dropping "we have to")

Break into editable parts: "The only thing | to fear | is | fear itself."

The editable parts would be "to fear" and "fear itself".

Wait, but to insert brand, maybe replace "fear itself" with something involving Photoshop.

So replacing "fear itself" with "not using Photoshop" → 

"The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop."

That's the final headline. 

Check constraints: no first-person, neutral. Yes. Includes brand. Ends with period. Keeps the structure. 

This seems to fit well. So the steps would be:

Step 1 quotes:

1. FDR's quote with ★

Step 2: Structure breakdown with editable parts.

Step 3: Replace "fear itself" with "not using Photoshop".

Step 4: The headline as above.

Alternatively, maybe the Disraeli quote is better. Let me think again.

If using "He who hesitates is lost", the headline could be "He who hesitates without Photoshop is lost." 

But "hesitates without" might not flow. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates is lost to Photoshop." No. 

Hmm, perhaps "He who hesitates to Photoshop is lost." 

But that uses "Photoshop" as a verb, which might be acceptable in a headline. 

So step 2 breakdown:

Original quote: "He who hesitates is lost."

Break into "He who hesitates | is | lost."

Editable parts: "hesitates" and "lost".

Replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates to Photoshop" (verb form) and "lost" with "missing out".

So "He who hesitates to Photoshop is missing out." 

That's one word change (replacing "hesitates" with "hesitates to Photoshop" – adding "Photoshop" as an object, so "hesitates to Photoshop" is two words, replacing one). Wait, the original word was "hesitates", now it's "hesitates to Photoshop" (two words). So that's changing one word to two, which is allowed? The user says change at most two words. Since "hesitates" is one word, changing it to "hesitates to Photoshop" adds two words, but replacing the original one. 

Alternatively, just adding "Photoshop" after hesitates: "hesitates to use Photoshop" which is four words. That's more changes. 

Hmm, perhaps better to do "He who hesitates to edit is lost. Photoshop keeps you ahead." But that's two lines. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates to Photoshop is lost." 

This uses "Photoshop" as a verb. 

Even though technically Photoshop is a noun, it's commonly used as a verb in colloquial terms. So this might be acceptable. 

Thus the final headline would be: "He who hesitates to Photoshop is lost."

This keeps the structure, adds the brand name as a verb, and conveys urgency. It's concise, within the word limits, and meets the constraints.

So comparing the two options:

Option 1: FDR's quote: "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop."

This addresses fear directly and neutralizes FOMO by suggesting that not using the tool is the real fear.

Option 2: Disraeli's: "He who hesitates to Photoshop is lost."

Focuses on urgency, suggesting that hesitation (without using the tool) leads to missing opportunities.

Both are valid, but since the persona is "fear" and the goal is to neutralize fear of missing out, FDR's quote might align better because it's about overcoming the fear itself by using Photoshop, whereas Disraeli's is more about the consequence of hesitation.

However, the user's example in the problem might prefer the FOMO aspect. 

Alternatively, maybe another quote. Let me think again.

What about "Nothing ventured, nothing gained." 

But author? Benjamin Franklin? 

Alternatively, "The only thing you can do is all you can do." 

No. 

Alternatively, "Success is not final; failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." Churchill. Too long.

Hmm.

Alternatively, the quote "Fear is the mind-killer." from Dune. But not classic enough, maybe.

Well, given the initial analysis, proceeding with the FDR quote might be better for the persona's fear aspect.

Thus, the final remix would be "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop." 

That's the conclusion.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Franklin D. Roosevelt ★  
   Matches as it directly addresses overcoming fear, aligning with neutralizing FOMO through Photoshop's empowerment.  
2. "He who hesitates is lost." Benjamin Disraeli  
   Matches urgency; hesitation implies missing opportunities, which Photoshop eliminates.  
3. "Time and tide wait for no man." George Herbert  
   Matches urgency of time, emphasizing Photoshop's role in timely creativity.  

Structure:  
The only thing | to fear | is | fear itself.  
Editable parts: "to fear" (verb) and "fear itself" (noun phrase).  

Replacements:  
Replace "fear itself" → "not using Photoshop" (conveys fear of missing out without the tool).  

Remix Headline:  
"The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop."
------------------------------------------

--- Generation for Photoshop | Fear ---
Token count: 5131

Okay, I need to work on this Photoshop headline remix. Let's start with Step 1: Quote Matching. The persona's tone is "Fear," and the brand is Photoshop. The goal is to neutralize fear of missing out or add urgency. 

First, I should think of classic quotes, slang, lyrics, memes, or expressions that relate to fear, missing out, or urgency. The quotes need to be 5-10 words. Let me brainstorm a few possibilities.

Hmm, "Failing to plan is planning to fail" by Alan Lakein. Wait, that's about preparation, which could tie into not being prepared with Photoshop leading to fear? Maybe. But how does it fit the fear of missing out (FOMO)?

Another one could be "The early bird catches the worm." That's about urgency, acting early. But does it connect to Photoshop? Maybe if the idea is to use Photoshop to avoid missing opportunities. 

Or maybe "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas" but that's more about secrecy. Not sure. 

Wait, "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take." by Wayne Gretzky. That's about taking action and not missing out. Perfect for FOMO! 

Another thought: "Time waits for no one" by Dante. Urgency. 

Or "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself" by FDR. But that's more about overcoming fear, maybe not exactly FOMO. 

Let me list three:

1. "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas." – Trademarked slogan. Maybe connects to keeping creativity in Photoshop? But not sure about FOMO. 

Wait, the persona is fear, so maybe the quote should be about the consequence of not acting, leading to fear. 

Wait the third quote idea: "You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf." by Jon Kabat-Zinn. Maybe about managing fear, but not directly FOMO. 

Alternatively, "Haste makes waste" but that's the opposite. 

Hmm, maybe "The greatest risk is not taking any risk." – Mark Zuckerberg. But not exactly FOMO. 

Wait, the user wants to neutralize fear of missing out. So maybe the quote should be something like "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." by Steve Jobs. No, that's not fear related.

Wait, "Nothing ventured, nothing gained." – proverb. That's about taking risks. 

Alternatively, "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened." – The Beatles. Not related.

Wait, "He who hesitates is lost." – proverb. That's about urgency and fear of missing out. Perfect! That's a good fit.

Another quote could be "Better late than never." But that's the opposite of urgency.

Alternatively, "Strike while the iron is hot." Urgency. 

So possible candidates:

1. "The early bird catches the worm." – Proverb. This is about acting early to seize opportunities. So if someone doesn't use Photoshop, they might miss out on opportunities, hence the fear. Matches urgency and FOMO.

2. "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take." – Wayne Gretzky. Directly addresses missing out. The idea is that if you don't take action (like using Photoshop to create), you'll miss opportunities. Matches FOMO perfectly.

3. "He who hesitates is lost." – Proverb. Urgency: hesitation leads to missing out. If someone hesitates to use Photoshop, they might lose out on their creative potential. 

Now I need to choose the best three, each with authors, and explain why they match.

First quote: "The early bird catches the worm." Matches because it's about acting quickly to gain advantage, which Photoshop can help users do, avoiding missing out on creative opportunities.

Second quote: "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take." Directly addresses FOMO, so using Photoshop would be the "shot" they need to take. 

Third quote: "He who hesitates is lost." Urgency in taking action with Photoshop to avoid being left behind.

Which is the best? The second one by Gretzky is the most relevant to FOMO. The first is about early action, the third about hesitation. Gretzky's quote is directly about missing opportunities if you don't act, so that's the best match (★).

Now Step 2: Structure Breakdown. Take the ★ quote: "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take." | separate editable parts. Let's see:

Original structure: You miss [percentage] of the [plural noun] you don’t [verb].

The editable parts would be percentage, noun, verb. But maybe in this case, "shots" could be replaced with a Photoshop-related term. The brand name would be integrated somehow.

Step 3: Replacements. The goal is to replace at most two words. Maybe "shots" can become "designs" or "edits", and "miss" could stay, but perhaps "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make with Photoshop." Wait, but that's adding Photoshop. Alternatively, replacing "shots" with "opportunities" and adding Photoshop. But need to keep syntax. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t perfect with Photoshop." Hmm, but "perfect" is a verb. Wait the original quote has "take", so maybe "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make with Photoshop." Or "You miss 100% of the ideas you don’t design with Photoshop."

Wait, the original quote is about taking shots (opportunities), so replacing "shots" with something Photoshop-related like "designs", "edits", "creations", "opportunities".

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the designs you don’t create with Photoshop." That's a possible replacement.

Another option: "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop." But that might be too forced. 

Or keeping "shots" and adding Photoshop as the tool: "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take with Photoshop." But that might not be the best.

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make." But adding the brand name is part of the replacement. The structure allows replacing up to two words plus the brand. Let me think.

The original quote is: "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take." 

To include Photoshop, maybe:

Replace "shots" with "edits" and add "Photoshop" at the end: "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make with Photoshop."

Or replace "shots" with "opportunities" and insert Photoshop: "You miss 100% of the opportunities you don’t capture with Photoshop."

Wait, but the structure is important. The user said to preserve rhythm and cadence, so changing "shots" to "edits" and adding "Photoshop" would be two changes (shots → edits, and then adding the brand). But since the limit is changing two words (and adding the brand counts as a change?), need to clarify.

Wait the user says "Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Ah, so replacing two words plus the brand can be counted as two words? Or adding the brand is part of the two changes.

Wait, the instruction says "changing at most two words from the original quote" and "Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit." So if you replace two words and add the brand, that's three changes, which is over. So need to either replace two words, or replace one and add the brand. 

So possible options:

Option 1: "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make with Photoshop." Here, replacing "shots" → "edits", and "take" → "make", but then also adding Photoshop. Wait that would be two changes (shots → edits and take → make) plus adding Photoshop. That's three changes, which is over.

Hmm, tricky. Let's see another way.

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t Photoshop." Replacing "take" with "Photoshop". But that might not make sense. "You don't Photoshop" isn't the right verb. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop." Again, verb is off. 

Hmm, maybe structure: "You miss 100% of the [Photoshop] you don’t take." No, that doesn't work. 

Another approach: Keep "shots", but add Photoshop: "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take with Photoshop." Here, "shots" stays, "take" stays, but added "with Photoshop" at the end. That would be adding the brand as a new phrase. So changing the verb and adding the brand? Wait, "with Photoshop" is an addition, so that's a change (adding "with Photoshop") but the original had "don’t take". So replacing "take" with "take with Photoshop" is more than one word change. 

Alternatively, replace "shots" with "designs" and end with "Photoshop": "You miss 100% of the designs you don’t take with Photoshop." Hmm, still not great. 

Wait maybe the best is to replace "shots" with "edits" and keep "take", then add Photoshop at the end as a separate phrase. 

"You miss 100% of the edits you don’t take with Photoshop." That way, "shots" → "edits", and adding "with Photoshop" is the other change. So two changes: replacing "shots" with "edits" and adding "with Photoshop" (counts as one change? Since it's adding a phrase, maybe it's considered one change. The user says "changing at most two words from the original quote". Adding the brand counts as a change. So if the original was "shots" → replace that (one), and adding the brand (second). So that works.

So the sentence would be "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t take with Photoshop." 

Alternatively, replacing "shots" with "opportunities" and adding Photoshop: "You miss 100% of the opportunities you don’t take with Photoshop." That's also possible. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop." (Replacing "shots" with "edits" and "take" with "Photoshop"). But "don't Photoshop" is a verb, which might not be natural. Photoshop is a noun here. 

Hmm. Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make with Photoshop." Here, "shots" → "edits", and "take" → "make", but that's two changes, plus adding the brand? Wait no, "with Photoshop" is added at the end. So "shots" becomes "edits", and then adding "with Photoshop" is the second change. So two changes. 

So "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make with Photoshop." 

Alternatively, maybe "You miss 100% of the creativity you don’t capture with Photoshop." But that changes more words. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the designs you don’t Photoshop." (shots → designs, take → Photoshop). But again, the verb is off. 

Alternatively, keep "shots" and add Photoshop as the tool: "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take using Photoshop." But that's "using Photoshop" which might be adding more than one word. 

Hmm, maybe the best option is replacing "shots" with "edits" and adding "with Photoshop" at the end. 

So step 3: replacements would be:

Option 1: Replace "shots" → "edits", and add "with Photoshop" at the end. So the structure is You miss [X]% of the [plural noun] you don’t [verb] [prepositional phrase].

Alternatively, maybe "designs" instead of "edits". 

Another option: "You miss 100% of the ideas you don’t create with Photoshop." Here, "shots" → "ideas", "take" → "create". But that's two changes. 

I think the key is to keep as much of the original structure as possible while inserting Photoshop. The best might be "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make with Photoshop." 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t take with Photoshop." Because the original uses "take shots", so "take edits" isn't right, but "make edits" is better. So replacing "shots" with "edits", "take" with "make", but that's two word changes, so that would be allowed? Wait the limit is changing two words from the original. The original is "shots" and "take". 

Original quote words: You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.

If we replace "shots" with "edits" and "take" with "make", that's two word changes, so allowed. Then adding the brand name would be the third, but the user says adding the brand counts towards the two-word limit. Wait, the instruction says: "Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Ah, so replacing two words and adding the brand (which is a third change) would exceed the limit. So need to only make two changes total, including the brand. 

Therefore, perhaps replacing one word and adding the brand as the second change. 

For example: Replace "shots" with "edits", and add "with Photoshop" at the end. That's two changes: "shots" → "edits" (first change), and "take" → "take with Photoshop" (but that's adding a phrase, which might count as a single change). Alternatively, adding "Photoshop" as the second change. 

Wait the structure breakdown in Step 2 needs to separate fixed and editable parts. Let me re-express the structure:

Original quote: "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take."

Structure breakdown (Step 2) would separate the parts that can be changed. The user says to separate with | the editable and fixed parts. So maybe:

"You miss | 100% | of the | shots | you don’t | take |." 

But I think it's better to group into components. Maybe:

"You miss [X]% of the [noun] you don’t [verb]."

So fixed parts are "You miss % of the you don’t ." and the editable parts are the percentage, noun, verb. 

Alternatively, the user might want each component separated. 

The task says: "use | to separate editable and fixed parts." So maybe:

"You miss | 100% | of the | shots | you don’t | take |." 

Then, the editable parts are 100%, shots, take. 

The brand can be inserted into any of these, but preferably as a keyword. 

The goal is to replace words to include brand terms. 

For example, replacing "shots" with a Photoshop-related noun like "edits" or "designs". The brand name could be placed where?

Maybe after the verb, as in "Photoshop your designs". 

Hmm. 

So, for replacements (step 3), the options would be: 

Option 1: Replace "shots" with "edits" and add "with Photoshop" at the end. So:

"You miss 100% of the edits you don’t take with Photoshop."

Here, replacing "shots" with "edits" (one change) and adding "with Photoshop" at the end (second change). 

Alternatively, replacing "take" with "Photoshop" (but that may not make sense: "you don't Photoshop"). 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the designs you don’t create with Photoshop." Here, "shots" → "designs", and "take" → "create" (two changes). 

But adding the brand would require inserting it at the end as well, so maybe "designs" and "create with Photoshop" – that's two changes. 

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to outline the steps properly.

Step 2 Structure Breakdown:

Take the best quote (★): "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take." 

Structure breakdown into fixed and editable parts. Maybe the percentage (100%), noun (shots), and verb (take) are editable. The rest are fixed. 

So, structure: "You miss | 100% | of the | shots | you don’t | take | ." 

The fixed parts are "You miss" and "of the", "you don’t", and the rest are editable. 

Step 3: Replacements. Need to change at most two words plus the brand. 

Option 1: Replace "shots" with "edits" and "take" with "make", but that's two changes, but then adding Photoshop would be third. Not allowed. 

Alternatively, replace "shots" with "edits" and add "with Photoshop" at the end (counted as a second change). 

The final sentence would be: "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make with Photoshop." 

Here, "shots" → "edits" (change 1), "take" → "make" (change 2). But then "with Photoshop" is an addition. Wait, adding "with Photoshop" at the end counts as a third change, which is over the limit. 

Alternatively, just replace "shots" with "Photoshop edits" but that's too much. 

Hmm, maybe the best approach is to replace "shots" with "designs" and add "Photoshop" at the end as the verb? Not sure. 

Wait maybe the structure allows adding the brand as a noun. For example, "You miss 100% of the Photoshop you don’t use." But that doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop." (shots→edits, take→Photoshop). But "don’t Photoshop" is using the brand as a verb, which is acceptable (like "Xerox"). 

So "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop." Here, replacing "shots" with "edits", and "take" with "Photoshop" (verb). That's two changes. So that's within the limit. 

That might be better because it uses the brand name as a verb, which is clever. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t design with Photoshop." (shots→edits, take→design with Photoshop). But "design with Photoshop" is two words, so that's more than one change. 

Hmm. The verb "Photoshop" as a verb is good because it's a common usage (e.g., "Let me photoshoph that image"). 

So the headline could be: "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop." 

That only changes two words: "shots" → "edits", "take" → "Photoshop". 

That's two changes, within the limit. And it uses the brand name as a verb, which is effective. 

Alternatively, replacing "shots" with "designs": "You miss 100% of the designs you don’t Photoshop." 

Either way, that's a strong option. 

Another option: "You miss 100% of the creativity you don’t Photoshop." Here, replacing "shots" with "creativity" and "take" with "Photoshop". 

But "creativity" is abstract. "Edits" is more specific to Photoshop's function. 

I think "edits" is better. 

So step 3 replacements would be:

1. Replace "shots" with "edits", and "take" with "Photoshop". 

Reason: "Edits" directly relates to Photoshop's editing capabilities, and using "Photoshop" as a verb ties the brand action to the quote's message.

Another option (set 2):

2. Replace "shots" with "designs", and "take" with "design with Photoshop". Wait that's two words again. 

Alternatively, "design using Photoshop" but that's longer. 

Hmm. Maybe the first option is better. 

So the final remix headline would be: "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop."

That keeps the structure, uses the brand as a verb, and substitutes "shots" with "edits". 

Let me check the constraints: 

- No first-person. The headline is neutral. 

- Brand is mentioned (as a verb here, but the brand name is there). 

Yes. 

Another possible version is replacing "shots" with "opportunities" and "take" with "use Photoshop". But that would be "You miss 100% of the opportunities you don’t use Photoshop." But that's two changes (shots→opportunities, take→use Photoshop) which is two changes. Wait, "use Photoshop" is two words replacing "take". That's more than one word change, so that's over the limit. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the opportunities you don’t Photoshop." (shots→opportunities, take→Photoshop). That works, but "opportunities" is more generic. 

The first option with "edits" is more specific to Photoshop. 

Okay, so putting it all together.
</think>

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. **"You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take."** (Wayne Gretzky)  
Why: Directly addresses fear of missing opportunities, tying to Photoshop’s role in enabling creative action.  
2. **"The early bird catches the worm."** (Proverb)  
Why: Urgency to act early aligns with Photoshop’s utility in staying ahead creatively.  
3. **"He who hesitates is lost."** (Proverb)  
Why: Suggests hesitation leads to missed opportunities, reinforcing Photoshop’s value.  
★★★Best: *1* ties directly to FOMO and creative action.  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Original quote: *"You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take."*  
Structure: *You miss | 100% | of the | shots | you don’t | take |.*  
Editable words: "shots" (noun), "take" (verb). Replace to reflect brand keywords like *edits*, *designs*, or *Photoshop*.  

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
1. **Replace "shots" → "edits", "take" → "Photoshop"**  
Reason: "Edits" aligns with Photoshop’s editing function; using "Photoshop" as a verb ties the brand to action.  
2. **Replace "shots" → "designs", "take" → "design with Photoshop"**  
Reason: Less impactful but emphasizes the creative process, though longer phrasing risks rhythm.  

Step 4【Remix Generation】  
Final headline:  
**"You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop."**  

*Explanation*: Replaces "shots" with "edits" (Photoshop’s core function) and "take" with "Photoshop" as a verb, preserving the quote’s cadence while embedding the brand. The verb form "Photoshop" is colloquially accepted (e.g., “Let me Photoshop that image”) and ties the action directly to the software.

--- Generation for Photoshop | Fear ---
Token count: 2509

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a headline for Photoshop that neutralizes fear of missing out or adds urgency, using a remix of a classic quote. First, I need to find three quotes that fit the fear and urgency tone.

Starting with Step 1: Quote Matching. The persona is Fear, so the quotes should evoke anxiety about missing out or the need to act quickly. Let's think of famous lines. 

1. "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." That's FDR's quote. It's about overcoming fear, which could tie into Photoshop helping people not fear missing design opportunities. But maybe it's a bit too general.

2. "Time waits for no one." - Latin proverb. That's about urgency, which fits the FOMO aspect. If you don't use Photoshop now, you might miss out on creating better work. 

3. "The early bird gets the worm." Proverb again. Emphasizes acting quickly. If someone uses Photoshop, they get ahead. 

Hmm, which is the best? The second one, "Time waits for no one" feels more directly related to urgency. So I'll mark that with ★. 

Step 2: Structure Breakdown. Let's take the second quote. "Time waits for no one." I need to separate editable and fixed parts. Maybe "Time | waits for | no one." The brand keyword "Photoshop" could replace "Time", but that might not make sense. Alternatively, "No one" could be replaced. Wait, the structure should allow inserting the brand. Maybe the first part can be changed to "Photoshop waits for no one" but that's not right. Wait, the idea is to replace words with brand terms. Let me think again. The original quote is "Time waits for no one." So perhaps "Time waits for no | one." The "one" could be replaced with the target audience, like "designer". But maybe "Time waits for no one" → "Photoshop waits for no one" but that's not exactly. Alternatively, maybe "Wait, time won't stop." Hmm, maybe better to keep the structure and find where to insert Photoshop. 

Alternatively, "Time waits for no one" → "Don't let time wait" or something. Wait, the structure breakdown needs to show which parts can be edited. Let me write it as "Time | waits for | no one." Then, maybe "no one" can be replaced with "your creativity" or "your project." Alternatively, the first part "Time" could be swapped with "Photoshop" but that would change the meaning. 

Wait, perhaps better to replace "Time" with "Your design ideas" or "Opportunities"? Not sure. The key is to include the brand name. So maybe "Photoshop waits for no one" but that's not quite right. Alternatively, changing "Time" to "Your next project" but that might not fit. Hmm. Maybe the fixed parts are "waits for" and the first word can be a verb. Not sure yet. 

Step 3: Replacements. Let's think of possible keywords. The brand is Photoshop, so words like "design", "create", "edit", "perfect", "creativity", "opportunity", "urge". Maybe replacing "Time" with "Your creativity" or "The deadline". Or "no one" with "Photoshop". Wait, "Time waits for no Photoshop" doesn't make sense. 

Alternatively, changing "Time" to "Fear" but that's part of the persona. Wait, the quote needs to be remixed to address the fear of missing out. Maybe "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop" taking FDR's quote but that was my first quote idea. Wait, in Step 1, I considered three quotes. Let me go back. 

Wait, in Step 1 the best was "Time waits for no one". So for structure: "Time waits for | no one." So the editable part is "no one". To insert the brand, maybe "no designer" or "no creator". But that's just replacing a word. To include Photoshop, perhaps "Time waits for no Photoshop user" but that's awkward. 

Alternatively, maybe rephrase the quote to include the brand. For example, "Time waits for no one, but Photoshop can pause creativity." No, that's not good. Hmm. Maybe "Don't let time wait – use Photoshop now!" but that's adding words. 

Wait, the user's instruction says to replace at most two words. Let me think again. The original quote: "Time waits for no one." To include "Photoshop", maybe "Time waits for no creator", but that's just a minor change. Alternatively, "Photoshop waits for no one" if the structure allows. Wait, but does that make sense? If the message is that you shouldn't wait to use it, maybe "Time waits for no one – but Photoshop helps you catch up." But that's more than two words. 

Alternatively, replacing "Time" with "Fear" gives "Fear waits for no one" but that might not be right. 

Hmm. Maybe the first quote I listed is better here. Let me revisit the first quote: "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." (FDR) 

If I use that as the best quote, maybe the structure is "The only thing to fear is fear | itself." 

Then replacing "fear itself" with "not using Photoshop" → "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop." That's one word replaced (fear itself → not using Photoshop). That would make sense: Fear is caused by not using Photoshop, so using it removes the fear. 

Alternatively, "The only thing to fear is... missing out on Photoshop's power." 

Wait, that's "fear of missing out" which aligns with the persona goal. That might be better. 

Wait, perhaps the first quote is more fitting because it directly addresses fear. Let me reevaluate. 

Original persona is fear of missing out (FOMO) or urgency. FDR's quote is about overcoming fear. If the brand is Photoshop, maybe "The only thing to fear is... not using Photoshop." That would neutralize FOMO. 

So maybe in Step 1, the best quote is the first one. Let me adjust my initial choices. 

Let me list the three quotes again properly:

1. "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Franklin D. Roosevelt – Matches because it addresses overcoming fear, suggesting Photoshop can help eliminate the fear of inadequate design.

2. "Time waits for no one." Latin proverb – Matches urgency, implying Photoshop is essential before opportunities pass.

3. "The early bird gets the worm." Proverb – Matches urgency, suggesting Photoshop users get ahead.

Wait, but maybe the first quote is better for FOMO. So the best match (★) would be the first. Then structure breakdown would be different. 

Let me redo Step 1:

Step 1:

1. "The only thing to fear is fear itself." Franklin D. Roosevelt – Matches because it addresses fear, suggesting Photoshop helps overcome it by providing tools to create confidently.

2. "Time waits for no one." Latin proverb – Matches urgency, implying the need to act now with Photoshop to avoid missing opportunities.

3. "Don't let the fear of perfection be the enemy of good." Voltaire – Wait, not sure about that. Alternatively, maybe "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself" is better.

Wait, perhaps my initial best choice should have been the first one. Let me pick that as ★. Then proceed with structure breakdown.

So if the quote is "The only thing to fear is fear itself." The structure breakdown would be:

Structure: "The only thing to fear is | fear itself."

Replace "fear itself" with something related to not using Photoshop. 

Then replacements: 

Option 1: "not using Photoshop" → "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop." That makes sense: fear comes from not using it, so using it removes fear. 

Option 2: "missing out on Photoshop" → "The only thing to fear is missing out on Photoshop." 

Alternatively, "the fear of missing out on Photoshop's features."

Wait, but limited to two words replaced. Original phrase is "fear itself". Replacing "fear itself" with "not using Photoshop" would be a longer replacement, but the instruction says "replace" so maybe you can insert phrases. Wait the instruction says "point out which words can be replaced with brand keywords and why". Maybe "fear itself" can be replaced with "not using Photoshop", which is two words. So "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop." 

That works. 

So then the remix would be that headline. 

Alternatively, if I go back to the second quote. Let's see:

If using "Time waits for no one." The structure is "Time waits for | no one." 

To include Photoshop, maybe "Time waits for no designer" or "Time waits for no creator". Then the headline would be "Time waits for no designer – embrace Photoshop now." But that adds a phrase. Alternatively, "Time waits for no one, but Photoshop helps you keep up." 

Hmm. But the instruction says the final headline should end with punctuation and keep original syntax and meter. So maybe replacing "no one" with "your creativity" but not sure. 

Alternatively, "Time waits for no one, so use Photoshop now!" But that changes the structure. 

Hmm. It might be better to go with the first quote, as it directly addresses fear, which aligns with the persona. 

Proceeding with that approach:

Step 1:

1. ★"The only thing to fear is fear itself." Franklin D. Roosevelt – Matches because it addresses fear, suggesting Photoshop helps overcome it by providing tools to create confidently.

2. "Time waits for no one." Latin proverb – Matches urgency, implying the need to act now with Photoshop to avoid missing opportunities.

3. "The early bird gets the worm." Proverb – Matches urgency, suggesting Photoshop users get ahead.

Step 2 Structure: "The only thing to fear is | fear itself." 

Editable part is the second "fear itself".

Replacement options: replace with "not using Photoshop" or "missing out on Photoshop".

Step 3: 

Replacements: 

Option 1: "not using Photoshop" → because it shifts the fear source to inaction (not using the tool), aligning with neutralizing fear of missing out.

Option 2: "ignoring Photoshop" → similar idea.

Step 4: 

Final headline would be: "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop."

That ends with period, keeps the structure, includes brand, and addresses the fear of missing out by implying fear comes from not using it.
</think>

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. ★"The only thing to fear is fear itself." — Franklin D. Roosevelt  
   Matches because it frames fear as solvable, suggesting Photoshop eliminates the anxiety of inadequacy.  

2. "Time waits for no one." — Latin proverb  
   Matches urgency, implying deadlines loom and Photoshop helps seize fleeting creative opportunities.  

3. "The early bird gets the worm." — Proverb  
   Matches urgency, positioning Photoshop users as proactive creators capitalizing on moments.  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Structure: "The only thing to fear is | fear itself."  
Replaceable words: "fear itself" → brand-related phrase (fear source).  

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
Replacements:  
- "not using Photoshop" → Shifts fear origin to inaction, aligning with FOMO.  
- "ignoring creativity" → Abstract but aligns with missing opportunities, weaker link to brand.  

Step 4【Remix Generation】  
Remix Headline: "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop."
------------------------------------------

--- Generation for Photoshop | Fear ---
Token count: 3342

Okay, I need to help the user create a headline for Photoshop that addresses the fear of missing out or adds urgency. Let me start with Step 1, finding three classic quotes that fit the mood.

First, I should think of quotes related to fear, urgency, or missing out. Maybe something like "The early bird catches the worm," but that's more about being proactive. Wait, the user mentioned fear of missing out (FOMO), so perhaps phrases that emphasize missing something if you don't act.

"The best things in life are free." Hmm, not sure about that. Maybe "Never look back" from The Killers' song? That's about moving forward without regrets, which could tie into not missing out on opportunities. 

Another thought: "The early bird catches the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese." That's a meme, but the original is "The early bird..." Maybe that's too long. Need something shorter, 5-10 words. 

Wait, there's the meme "The man who chases two rabbits catches none." Not exactly fear of missing out. 

How about the quote "He who hesitates is lost" by Proverb? That's about urgency. If you hesitate, you might miss out. That fits the persona's fear of missing out or needing urgency. 

Another option: "Strike while the iron is hot." Also about urgency, but maybe not as directly related to fear. 

Wait, the user wants to neutralize FOMO or add urgency. The song lyric "No looking back" by Blink-182? Or "Don't Stop Believin'" by Journey? Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Time waits for no one" by Hesiod. But that's more about time passing. 

Hmm, maybe "The devil is in the details" but that's about attention to detail. 

Wait, the quote "Opportunity knocks but once" – that's about missing out if you don't seize it. Maybe from Benjamin Franklin? Not sure the exact author, but it's a common saying. 

Let me list three options. 

1. "The devil is in the details." (Proverb) – emphasizes attention to detail, but maybe not urgency. 

Wait, maybe "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take" – Pele. That's about taking chances, so if you don't act, you miss out. That's perfect for FOMO. 

Yes, that's a good candidate. 

Another: "Strikes twice, thrice, never" from "It" by Stephen King. But that's more horror. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates is lost" (Proverb). 

Third option: "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." Eleanor Roosevelt – too positive, maybe not. 

Alternatively, "Don't wait" – but not a full quote. 

Let me settle on three:

1. "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." (Pele) – directly addresses missing out if you don't act. 

2. "He who hesitates is lost." (Proverb) – urgency to act now. 

3. "The early bird catches the worm." (Proverb) – acting early. 

Wait, "The early bird" is more about being first, but the user wants to neutralize FOMO or add urgency. "You miss 100%..." seems best. The hesitation quote is second. Early bird third. 

Now, explanations why each matches:

1. Directly relates to fear of missing out because not taking action means missing opportunities. 

2. Hesitation leads to missing out, so urgency is key. 

3. Acting early prevents missing out, so fits urgency. 

Marking the best as the first one. 

Proceeding to structure breakdown. The best is "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." Split into editable parts. The quote is "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." 

The brand is Photoshop, so replacing "shots" with something related to editing? Or "miss" with a Photoshop term. Maybe "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make." Hmm, but edits might not fit. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the moments you don't enhance." Wait, but the original quote's structure is important. Let me see the structure: 

Original: "You miss [100% of the] shots you don't take." 

The editable parts could be "shots" and "take." But the user wants to replace up to two words. So replacing "shots" and "take" with Photoshop-related terms. 

Alternatively, "You miss [100% of the] photos you don't perfect." But that changes the meaning a bit. 

Hmm, maybe "You miss 100% of the masterpieces you don't create." But that's adding words. 

Alternatively, keep "shots" as photos? "You miss 100% of the photos you don't edit." Wait, but the original quote is about taking action (taking shots, i.e., attempting), so editing is the action here. 

Wait, the original quote's "take" refers to taking the shot (as in shooting a basketball). If in Photoshop, the action is editing, so maybe "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make." But the rhythm is off. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the moments you don't capture" – but capture is more about photography than editing. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the details you don't fix." 

Hmm, maybe "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make." Let me see. The original structure is "You miss [quantifier] of the [noun] you don't [verb]." 

So replacing noun and verb. Maybe noun: edits, retouches, etc. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the masterpieces you don't Photoshop." Wait, but the verb would be "Photoshop" which is a verb? "You don't Photoshop" sounds awkward. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the masterpieces you don't perfect in Photoshop." But that's too long. 

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to keep the structure but replace "shots" with "edits" and "take" with "make". 

So "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make." 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the details you don't perfect." 

Alternatively, since the brand is Photoshop, maybe include the brand name in the headline. 

The user says "include brand name / keyword". So maybe "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." But that's a bit forced. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the masterpieces you don't edit in Photoshop." But again, length. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the details you don't perfect with Photoshop." 

Hmm, but the original quote's brevity is important. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make with Photoshop." But that's adding words. 

Wait, the user allows changing up to two words. Let me look again. 

Original quote: "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." 

Editable parts: "shots" and "take". 

Replace "shots" with "edits" and "take" with "make" → "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make." 

But that's a bit too much. Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make." 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the moments you don't edit." 

But "moments" isn't directly related to editing. 

Hmm, perhaps "You miss 100% of the pixels you don't perfect." 

But that's getting too specific. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." Using the verb form. 

Not sure, but maybe that's the way. 

Alternatively, keeping "shots" as photos. 

Wait, maybe "You miss 100% of the photos you don't edit." 

Yes, because "photos" is related to the brand. 

Then the replacements would be "photos" instead of "shots" and "edit" instead of "take". 

So changing two words: shots → photos; take → edit. 

That would make the headline "You miss 100% of the photos you don't edit." 

Including the brand name: "You miss 100% of the photos you don't edit in Photoshop." 

But that adds "in Photoshop" as an extra, but since the limit is two word changes plus the brand name, maybe the brand name is added. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." 

But that's more awkward. 

Hmm. The user wants the brand name included. Let me think again. 

Original structure breakdown: 

Structure: You miss | 100% of the | shots | you don't | take. 

The brand should be included, perhaps in place of "take" as the verb? 

Wait, "take" is the verb. So changing "take" to "edit" → "you don't edit". 

And changing "shots" to "photos", then adding "with Photoshop" at the end. 

But that might go over word count. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make with Photoshop." 

But that changes two words and adds the brand. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the masterpieces you don't edit with Photoshop." 

But maybe that's okay. 

Alternatively, stick to the two-word replacement. Let me see the user's constraints again: 

"Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So adding the brand name is a change. So if I change two words and add the brand name, that's over. 

Wait, the total changes (replaced words + brand name addition) should be ≤2? Or changing two words, and adding the brand name counts as an extra? 

The instruction says "changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

Ah, so adding the brand name counts as one of the changes. So replacing two words and adding the brand would be three changes, which is over. 

Therefore, the maximum is two changes total, including the brand. 

Hmm, that complicates things. 

Let me try to minimize changes. 

Maybe the best is to replace "shots" with "edits" and "take" with "make", but that's two changes, and then adding "with Photoshop" at the end. But the original quote doesn't have that, so maybe it's better to not add the brand name and just have the two replacements. 

But the user says "include brand name / keyword". 

So perhaps the brand keyword is "Photoshop" and needs to be included. 

Hmm. Maybe the structure allows inserting the brand name in place of one of the words. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." Replacing "shots" with "edits" and "take" with "Photoshop". That's two changes. 

So the headline would be "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." 

But "Photoshop" as a verb is acceptable. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the photos you don't edit in Photoshop." 

Changing "shots" to "photos" and "take" to "edit", then adding "in Photoshop" at the end. But that's three changes (two replacements plus adding the brand). So over the limit. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make in Photoshop." 

Here, "shots" → "edits", "take" → "make", and then adding "in Photoshop" is an addition, which counts as a third change. Not allowed. 

Hmm. Maybe the brand name is added without replacing words. 

The original quote is: "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." 

If we add "with Photoshop" at the end, that's adding two words but doesn't replace. Wait, but adding the brand name counts as a change? 

Wait, the instruction says "Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit." So adding "Photoshop" as a brand name is considered a change. 

So for example, the original quote has five words (excluding quantifier maybe). 

If I add "Photoshop" to the end, that's an addition. But how many changes? 

Perhaps the best approach is to have the brand name as a replacement. 

Like "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." 

Here, replacing "shots" with "edits" (one change), and "take" with "Photoshop" (second change). 

Thus, two changes, and the brand name is inserted as the verb. 

That works. 

So the headline would be: "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." 

Alternatively, replacing "shots" with "Photoshop edits"? No, too long. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the moments you don't Photoshop." 

Hmm. Not sure. 

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the details you don't perfect with Photoshop." 

But that would be changing "shots" to "details", "take" to "perfect", plus adding "with Photoshop" as three changes. 

Over. 

Hmm, perhaps the best is to keep the structure and just add "Photoshop" in the beginning? 

Like "Photoshop: You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." But that doesn't integrate the brand into the quote. 

The user wants the brand in the headline, but the quote remix. 

Alright, maybe the first approach with two replacements: "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." 

That includes the brand as a verb, which is a common usage (to photoshop an image). 

That would be the best fit under the constraints.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take." (Pele) ★  
*Directly addresses fear of missing opportunities by emphasizing action over hesitation. The "shots" metaphor aligns with taking risks to achieve results.*  
2. "He who hesitates is lost." (Proverb)  
*Focuses on urgency but lacks the actionable "missing out" tension required.*  
3. "The early bird catches the worm." (Proverb)  
*Implies proactive success but doesn’t tie to the psychological fear of missing out.*  

Structure:  
You miss | 100% of the | shots | you don’t | take.  

Replacements:  
1. *edits* (instead of *shots*) | *Photoshop* (instead of *take*)  
*Rationale: "Edits" ties directly to Photoshop’s purpose. "Photoshop" as a verb is a common brand action (e.g., "I’ll Photoshop this later").*  

Remix Headline:  
"You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop."

Okay, I need to come up with three quotes that match the persona of "Fear" for Photoshop. The goal is to neutralize fear of missing out or add urgency. Let's think about quotes related to fear, missing out, or urgency.

First quote: Maybe something about not wanting to be left behind. "Don't leave your dreams behind" by someone. That's about not missing out on dreams, which ties into FOMO.

Second quote: "The early bird catches the worm." It's about acting quickly, which adds urgency. The author is unknown, but it's a common proverb.

Third quote: "Better late than never" by Benjamin Franklin. Wait, but that might not be right for urgency. Maybe a better one. Hmm. Alternatively, "You can't miss the boat if you're on it." Not a real quote. Maybe "Better to have loved and lost..." but that's not exactly it. Wait, maybe "The best things in life are free" isn't right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, "Don't let your fears hold you back." Author? Maybe Winston Churchill? Not sure. But that's more about overcoming fear. Alternatively, "Nothing ventured, nothing gained" by Peter Sellaer. That's about taking risks. But how does that tie to Photoshop?

Wait, the brand is Photoshop. So maybe the quotes should relate to creativity, editing, not missing out on opportunities. 

First option: "Miss no detail." Not a quote. Maybe "Pay attention to details." Hmm.

Alternatively, think of lyrics. "Don't stop believin'" from Journey. But that's more about perseverance. Not exactly fear of missing out. 

Alternatively, "The devil is in the details." But that's more about thoroughness. 

Hmm. Let me try again.

First quote: "Don't let your fears hold you back from creating your best work." But needs to be concise. Maybe shorten to "Don't let your fears hold you back." Author: Unknown, but maybe a motivational quote.

Second: "The opportunity you wait for may never come." – Chinese proverb? Or "Strike while the iron is hot." That's about urgency.

Third: "Don’t miss your chance to shine." – common saying. Maybe from a song? Not sure. 

Wait, the user wants each quote to be 5-10 words. Let me structure them properly.

Option 1: "The devil is in the details." – Unknown. But how does that relate to fear? Maybe not directly. 

Option 2: "Don’t let your fears limit your creativity." Short, but maybe the author? Maybe someone like Maya Angelou? Not sure, but it's a made-up quote. 

Alternatively, think of movie quotes. "You can't stop the future, you can't rewind the past." – from Flight of the Navigator? Or maybe "The past can't be changed, but the future sure can." Not quite.

Wait, the persona is fear, so the quote should evoke fear of missing out. The original quote needs to be classic. Let me think again.

"Missing out on the best things in life" isn't a quote. 

Wait, "You only live once." But that's about seizing the moment, maybe not FOMO. 

Hmm, perhaps "Better late than never" is about urgency but in reverse. Alternatively, "The early bird catches the worm." That's good for urgency. 

So for step 1, three quotes:

1. "Don’t miss your chance to shine." – Unknown. Matches because it addresses the fear of missing out on opportunities to stand out, aligning with Photoshop's role in helping users enhance their work.

2. "The early bird catches the worm." – Unknown. Urgency to act quickly, which neutralizes fear by emphasizing proactive steps.

3. "Fear is the mind-killer." – Dune's "Litany Against Fear". Directly addresses fear but might be too specific. Matches the persona's fear theme, suggesting Photoshop helps overcome it.

Mark the best as the Dune one? Or the first? The first is more about FOMO, which the persona goal mentions. So maybe the first quote is best. Or the Dune quote is better for addressing fear directly.

Wait, the goal is to neutralize fear of missing out (FOMO) or add urgency. The "Litany Against Fear" directly addresses fear, which might be better. 

But the user's example used "Better late than never" marked with ★. Wait, in the example given earlier (from the user's previous input?), perhaps "Fear is the mind-killer" would be the best. Let me check again.

Alternatively, "Don’t miss your chance to shine" is more about FOMO, so maybe that's better for the persona goal. 

So for the three quotes:

1. "Fear is the mind-killer." (Frank Herbert, Dune) ★ because it directly addresses fear and offers a way to overcome it, which Photoshop could represent as the tool that neutralizes fear by enabling creativity.

2. "The early bird catches the worm." – unknown. Urgency to act quickly, which adds urgency as per the persona goal.

3. "Don’t let your fears hold you back." – unknown. Encourages overcoming fear, but less specific to FOMO or Photoshop's role.

Hmm, maybe the first quote (Dune) is best. 

Alternatively, maybe "Better late than never" is not matching. Let me think of other quotes.

Another idea: "Opportunity knocks once." – John Heywood. Matches FOMO. 

So three quotes:

1. "Fear is the mind-killer." – Frank Herbert ★

2. "Opportunity knocks but once." – John Heywood

3. "The early bird catches the worm." – proverb.

Explanation for first: addresses fear directly, which the persona is about, and the brand helps overcome that fear by providing tools to create without hesitation.

Second matches FOMO, urgency not to miss the opportunity.

Third about urgency to act early.

Probably the Dune quote is best as it directly deals with fear. So structure breakdown would split that quote.

But the user wants to make sure the quotes are classic, so maybe Dune is considered a classic? Yes, Frank Herbert's Dune is a classic.

So step 1:

1. "Fear is the mind-killer." – Frank Herbert (Dune) ★ Matches directly addressing fear, offering a path to overcome it, which aligns with Photoshop's creative empowerment.

2. "The early bird catches the worm." – Unknown. Matches urgency to act swiftly to avoid missing opportunities.

3. "Opportunity knocks once." – John Heywood. Matches fear of missing out on chances, emphasizing timely action.

Yes, that works. Now, step 1 is done. The user might proceed to step 2 next.
</think>

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. "Fear is the mind-killer." – Frank Herbert (Dune) ★ Matches directly addressing fear, offering a path to overcome it, which aligns with Photoshop’s creative empowerment.  
2. "The early bird catches the worm." – Unknown Matches urgency to act swiftly to avoid missing opportunities.  
3. "Opportunity knocks once." – John Heywood Matches fear of missing out on chances, emphasizing timely action.  

---

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Structure: Fear | is the mind-killer.  
Editable: *Fear*, *mind* | Fixed: is the ——.  

Replace "Fear" with the brand (Photoshop) to shift focus to the tool alleviating fear. Replace "mind-killer" with a phrase tying creativity/urgency to Photoshop’s purpose.  

---

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
1. **Photoshop** | is the *worry-crusher*.  
   (Replaces "Fear" → brand; "mind-killer" → "worry-crusher" to emphasize overcoming anxiety through creation.)  
2. **Photoshop** | is the *idea-saver*.  
   (Replaces "Fear" → brand; "mind-killer" → "idea-saver" to highlight salvaging creativity.)

Step 4【Remix Generation】

Okay, so the user wants me to come up with a headline for Photoshop that neutralizes fear of missing out or adds urgency. The persona's tone is fear, and the brand is Photoshop. Let's start with Step 1: Quote Matching. I need three classic quotes that fit the mood of fear and the brand.

First, I should think about quotes related to fear, urgency, or missing out. Maybe something like "The early bird catches the worm" but that's more about being proactive. Or "There's no time like the present," but that's more about taking action now. Hmm. Wait, "Don't wait until it's too late" could work because it's about urgency. The author might be unknown, but it's a common saying.

Another option: "Opportunities knock once," which is from Shakespeare, I think. "Opportunity seldom knocks twice." That's by Thomas Fuller. That phrase is about not missing chances, which ties into fear of missing out. 

Or maybe "Time waits for no one" by Sappho? That's about urgency. Let me check those. 

So three quotes: 

1. "Don't wait until it's too late." – Common saying. Matches urgency and fear of missing the chance to act. 

2. "Opportunity seldom knocks twice." – Thomas Fuller. Fits the fear of missing out on opportunities, so Photoshop could help capture moments before they're gone. 

3. "Time waits for no one." – Sappho. Also about urgency, making the most of time, which ties into not delaying using Photoshop to create now. 

Which is the best? The second one connects directly to missing opportunities, so maybe that's the best. So mark that with ★. 

Now Step 2: Structure Breakdown. Take the ★ quote: "Opportunity seldom knocks twice." Need to separate fixed and editable parts. Maybe "Opportunity" and "seldom knocks twice" as fixed? Wait, but the structure is [Subject] [verb phrase]. The brand would replace "Opportunity"? Or maybe "Opportunity" can be replaced with Photoshop's benefit. Hmm. Wait the structure breakdown needs to identify parts that can be replaced. 

Breaking down "Opportunity | seldom knocks twice." The word "Opportunity" could be replaced with "Your Creativity" or "Your Ideas" to tie into Photoshop. Alternatively, "seldom" could be changed but maybe not. The goal is to keep the structure but insert brand keywords. 

Step 3: Replacements. Maybe replacing "Opportunity" with "Your Vision" or "Your Moment". Because the idea is that if you don't capture/edit your moment with Photoshop, you might miss it. Or "Your Creativity" to highlight that Photoshop helps you seize creative opportunities before they pass. 

Alternatively, "The Moment" as the subject. So "The Moment seldom knocks twice | – Capture it with Photoshop!" But the original structure was "Opportunity seldom knocks twice." So replacing "Opportunity" with "Your Next Masterpiece" or "Your Creativity". 

Step 4: Remix. Using the best replacement, like "Your Creativity seldom knocks twice." Then add Photoshop at the end? Wait the structure needs to fit. The original quote's structure is a statement, so maybe turn it into a command. Alternatively, "Your Vision seldom knocks twice – Edit it with Photoshop!" 

Alternatively, "Don’t miss your moment. Photoshop keeps creativity alive." Hmm but that might not follow the structure. Wait, the example given in the user's format requires keeping the original syntax. So sticking with the quote structure. Let me try again. 

Original quote: "Opportunity seldom knocks twice." 

Replace "Opportunity" with "Your Vision" or "Your Creativity". So "Your Creativity seldom knocks twice – Photoshop catches it every time." Wait but the original quote's structure is a declarative sentence. Maybe "Your next masterpiece seldom knocks twice – Photoshop helps you seize it." Hmm. Maybe better to make it a headline ending with the brand. 

Wait the user's example in the output had the remix headline as a quote ending with punctuation. Let me think again. Maybe "Your Moment Seldom Knocks Twice" with Photoshop as the solution. So "Your Moment Seldom Knocks Twice. Photoshop Catches It Every Time." But the brand name needs to be included. Alternatively, "Your Vision Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Seizes It." 

Wait the user's Step 4 says to include the brand name/keyword and end with punctuation. So perhaps:

Original structure breakdown: "Opportunity | seldom knocks twice."

Replacing "Opportunity" with "Your Creativity" gives: "Your Creativity seldom knocks twice." Then add the brand: "Your Creativity Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Catches It Every Time!" But that's changing more than two words. The constraint is to change at most two words, including adding the brand. Hmm. Wait the structure breakdown was "Opportunity | seldom knocks twice." So the fixed part is "seldom knocks twice." The editable is "Opportunity". So replacing that with a brand-related noun. 

Maybe "Capture it with Photoshop – Creativity seldom knocks twice." Wait not sure. Alternatively, "Your Vision Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Captures Every Moment." 

Wait the original quote is "Opportunity seldom knocks twice." To make it brand-related, perhaps "Your Creative Opportunity Seldom Knocks Twice. Photoshop Catches It Every Time." But that might be stretching the word count. Alternatively, keeping it concise: "Your Moment Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Seizes It." 

Hmm. The replacements should only change 1-2 words. Let's see. The original is "Opportunity seldom knocks twice." 

Option 1: Replace "Opportunity" with "Your Vision" → "Your Vision seldom knocks twice." Then add "Photoshop" as part of the headline. Maybe "Your Vision Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Catches It." But that adds two changes: replacing "Opportunity" and adding the brand. 

Alternatively, maybe replace "knocks" with "passes" and add the brand? But probably better to focus on the subject. 

Alternatively, the brand could be the subject? Not sure. 

The key is to keep the structure. Let me try the example again. 

Structure breakdown: "Opportunity | seldom knocks twice." 

Replace "Opportunity" with "Your Creativity" (one word change). Then add "Photoshop" at the end: "Your Creativity seldom knocks twice. Photoshop ensures it never misses." But that's more than two words. Alternatively, "Your Creativity seldom knocks twice – Photoshop captures it every time!" But that's two changes (replacing "Opportunity" and adding "Photoshop captures it every time"). Wait the constraint is "changing at most two words from the original quote, including adding the brand." 

Wait adding the brand counts as a change. Let me check the instructions again. 

Step 3 says: "Propose 1-2 replacement word/phrase sets with short reasons. Limit yourself to changing at most two words from the original quote to preserve its rhythm and cadence. Adding the brand name also counts towards this limit."

So replacing "Opportunity" with "Your Vision" (1 change) and then adding the brand name would be another. So two changes. 

Thus, the remix headline could be: "Your Vision Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Catches It." 

Or "Your Creativity Seldom Knocks Twice. Photoshop Ensures It Never Misses."

Alternatively, maybe "Your Next Masterpiece Seldom Knocks Twice. Photoshop Catches It Every Time!" 

Hmm. Maybe the best is to replace "Opportunity" with "Your Moment" and then add "Photoshop" as the verb part. 

Wait the original is a statement. To make it a headline, maybe turn it into a command. But the structure has to keep the syntax. 

Alternatively, "Your Moment Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Captures It." 

Yes, that's replacing "Opportunity" with "Your Moment" (one change), and adding "Photoshop" at the end. So two changes. That works. 

Then the headline would be "Your Moment Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Captures It." 

Alternatively, "Your Creativity Seldom Knocks Twice. Photoshop Never Misses." 

But "Never Misses" is part of the original? Not sure. 

Wait the user's example output format has the remix as a headline ending with punctuation. 

So putting it all together, maybe the best is "Your Moment Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Captures It."
</think>

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. *"Don’t wait until it’s too late."* – Common saying | Matches urgency to act before opportunities fade.  
2. *"Opportunity seldom knocks twice."* ★ – Thomas Fuller | Directly ties to fear of missing creative chances.  
3. *"Time waits for no one."* – Sappho | Emphasizes urgency, aligning with Photoshop’s time-sensitive creative needs.  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
Structure: *"Opportunity | seldom knocks twice."* | Replaceable word: *"Opportunity"* (brand-related noun, e.g., *"Your Creativity"*, *"Your Vision"*) to highlight what users risk losing.  

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
1. Replace *"Opportunity"* → *"Your Creativity"* | Because Photoshop enables capturing creative moments before they’re lost.  
2. Replace *"Opportunity"* → *"Your Vision"* | Reflects the fear of missing out on realizing artistic ideas.  

Step 4【Remix Generation】  
Remix Headline: *"Your Creativity Seldom Knocks Twice – Photoshop Captures It."*

--- Generation for Photoshop | Fear ---
Token count: 2820

Okay, so I need to create a headline for Photoshop that neutralizes the fear of missing out or adds urgency, using a remix of a classic quote, lyric, etc. Let's start with Step 1.

First, I should think of quotes related to fear, urgency, or missing out. Maybe something like "The early bird gets the worm" but that's more about timing. Or "Live every day like it's your last" – that's urgent. Wait, "YOLO" is slang. Maybe "YOLO" by Drake? Or "You only live once" as the phrase.

Another angle: fear of missing out (FOMO) – maybe "The grass is always greener on the other side"? Hmm, not exactly. How about "Don't miss out" directly? But that's too on the nose. 

Wait, "The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only a page." But that's more about travel. Maybe "Carpe diem" – seize the day. From Horace. That's good for urgency. "Seize the day" is a classic. 

Another thought: "Stranger things have happened." No, that's more about surprise. 

Wait, the persona is "fear" but the goal is to neutralize FOMO or add urgency. So the quote should be something that encourages action to avoid missing out or create urgency.

Possible quotes:
1. "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." – FDR. But that's more about overcoming fear, not FOMO.
2. "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." – Wayne Gretzky. That's about taking action, which could fit.
3. "The grass is always greener where you water it." – Unknown. Maybe, but not sure.
4. "Hurry up, the world is going somewhere." – Robert Frost? Not sure.
5. "Strike while the iron is hot." – Proverb. Urgency.
6. "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened." – Dr. Seuss. Not exactly.
7. "Opportunity knocks but once." – Thomas Fuller. That's good for urgency and FOMO.

Wait, maybe "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now." – Chinese proverb. But too long.

Alternatively, "Time waits for no one." – commonly attributed to Confucius or others. Short and about urgency.

So possible three quotes with authors:

1. "The best things in life happen when you least expect them." – Unknown. Maybe, but not sure.
Wait, I need 3 quotes that fit "fear of missing out" or urgency. Let me think again.

Option 1: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." – Steve Jobs. Not really related.

Wait, maybe "You can't stop the waves, but you can learn to surf." – Jon Kabat-Zinn. Not exactly.

Alternatively, "The early bird catches the worm." – Miguel de Cervantes. Urgency to act early.

Or "Seize the day, for tomorrow never comes." – John Dryden. That's a version of carpe diem.

Alternatively, "The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese." – Not sure who.

Hmm. Let me try to list 3 with authors:

1. "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." – Wayne Gretzky. This is about taking action to avoid missing opportunities. Perfect for FOMO.
2. "The world is always in motion, but the brave seize the moment." – Not sure the author, maybe a variation of carpe diem. But need a real author. Alternatively, "Carpe diem" from Horace: "Seize the day, boys, and give little thought to the future."
3. "Don't wait. The time will never be 'just right.'" – Napoleon Hill. Urgency, don't procrastinate.

Wait, let's check authors properly. The Gretzky one is correct. The Napoleon Hill quote is real. Carpe diem is from Horace's "Odes 1.11".

So step 1 requires 3 quotes with authors, each 5-10 words, matching the persona's fear of missing out or urgency.

First quote: Gretzky's "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." That's 8 words. Why matches? It directly addresses missing out (shots you don't take) so fits the FOMO aspect.

Second quote: "Seize the day, boys, and give little thought to the future." – Horace. 9 words. Matches urgency, encouraging action now.

Third quote: "Don't wait. The time will never be 'just right.'" – Napoleon Hill. 8 words. Matches urgency to act without delay.

Which is best? The Gretzky quote is more about missing opportunities, directly addressing FOMO. The others are more about urgency. Since the persona's goal is to neutralize fear of missing out OR add urgency, Gretzky's is best. So mark it with ★.

Step 1 done. Now Step 2: take the best quote and structure it.

The ★ quote is "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." | to separate editable parts.

Which words can be replaced? The key parts are "shots you don't take" – but maybe "shots" can be replaced with Photoshop-related terms. Alternatively, "You miss..." can be kept, and "shots you don't take" becomes something like "edits you don't make" or "opportunities you don't seize".

Wait, but brand is Photoshop, so "edits" is a keyword. The structure breakdown needs to show editable parts. Let's see:

Original: "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

Possible breakdown:

"You miss [100% of the] [shots you don't] take."

But perhaps breaking into:

"You miss [100% of the] [shots you don't] take."

So the editable parts could be "shots" (Photoshop's edits) and "take" (maybe "make" as in make edits? Or "use" Photoshop). Alternatively, "shots" could become "edits" and "take" stay as is, but the verb might not fit.

Alternatively, the phrase "shots you don't take" could be "opportunities you don't seize", but that's more general. The goal is to include the brand keyword. So replacing "shots" with "edits", "designs", "photos".

Replacement ideas:

Set 1: "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make." (Replace shots with edits, take with make.)

Reason: "Edits" relates to Photoshop's function. "Make" as in creating edits instead of taking shots. Maintains structure.

Set 2: "You miss every design when you don't Photoshop." (But that changes more words. Original has "100%", so maybe "You miss every design you don't Photoshopize." Hmm, not sure.)

Alternatively: "You miss 100% of the edits you don't try." (Replace "shots" with "edits", "take" with "try". But "try" may not fit the verb.)

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't create." So "create" as the verb.

So step 3 would be proposing those.

Then the remix would be something like "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make." But need to include the brand name? Wait, the brand is Photoshop. The instruction says to include brand name or keyword, so perhaps "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop."

Wait, but "Photoshop" as a verb is common. So replacing "take" with "Photoshop".

Original quote: "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

Replacement: "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." (shots → edits, take → Photoshop)

But does that make sense? "Edits you don't Photoshop" – but Photoshop is a tool, not the action. The action is editing using Photoshop. Maybe "You miss 100% of the edits you don't make with Photoshop." But that adds more words.

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't perfect." (Using "perfect" as a verb, but not brand-related.)

Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, changing "shots" to "opportunities" and adding the brand. Wait, perhaps:

"You miss 100% of the photos you don't edit with Photoshop."

But "photos" is a keyword. Let me see.

Original structure breakdown:

The best quote: "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take."

To structure breakdown: "You miss | 100% of the | shots | you don't | take." ?

Wait, maybe the editable parts are "shots" and "take". The key replacements are "shots" → "edits" or "photos", and "take" → "edit" or "Photoshop".

Alternatively, the fixed parts are "You miss 100% of the" and "you don't take."

So replacing "shots" with "photos" (since that's what Photoshop edits):

"You miss 100% of the photos you don't edit."

But "edit" instead of "take". Wait, but "take" is the verb. "Take shots" vs "edit photos".

Hmm. Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the edits you don't create." Then "create" as the verb, and "edits" as the noun.

Alternatively, to include the brand name, maybe "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." (Using Photoshop as a verb). That's a common usage, so maybe acceptable.

So step 3 replacements: "shots" → "edits", "take" → "Photoshop". That's two changes. The sentence becomes: "You miss 100% of the edits you don't Photoshop." Which includes the brand name as the verb.

Alternatively, "You miss 100% of the photos you don't Photoshopize." But "Photoshopize" is awkward. Maybe better to use "Photoshop" as the verb directly.

So the remix headline would be: "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop." (with the brand name at the end). But does that make sense? It's a bit forced, but it's a play on the original.

Alternatively, maybe "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t make." But then the brand isn't included unless we add it somewhere else. Hmm.

Wait, the user said "include brand name / keyword". So the brand is Photoshop. Maybe adding it at the end: "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop." (since Photoshop is a verb). That's two changes from the original (shots → edits, take → photoshop). That's two words changed, so acceptable.

Another possibility: "You miss 100% of the photos you don’t edit with Photoshop." Here, "shots" → "photos", and adding "with Photoshop" at the end. But that's more than two changes. The original was "you don't take". To say "you don’t edit with Photoshop", that's changing "take" to "edit" and adding "with Photoshop", which may be over the limit.

Alternatively, keep the structure but replace "shots" with "opportunities" and add "with Photoshop" at the end, but not sure.

Hmm, perhaps the best is "You miss 100% of the edits you don’t Photoshop." Even if it's a bit of a stretch, it's within the constraints and uses the brand name as a verb.

So putting it all together.

Explanation:  
1. **"You miss 100% of the shots you don't take." – Wayne Gretzky** ★  
   Matches FOMO by emphasizing missed opportunities.  
2. **"Seize the day, boys, and give little thought to the future." – Horace**  
   Matches urgency through action-focused language.  
3. **"Don’t wait. The time will never be 'just right.'" – Napoleon Hill**  
   Matches urgency by urging immediate action.  

Structure:  
**You miss 100% of the shots | you don't | take.**  
Editable parts: **shots** and **take**. Replace with brand-related terms.  

Replacements:  
1. **shots → edits**, **take → Photoshop**  
   *"Edits" reflects Photoshop's core function, and "Photoshop" as a verb reinforces the brand. Maintains original cadence.*  
2. **shots → photos**, **take → perfect**  
   *"Photos" ties to the brand's domain, while "perfect" implies refining images.*

--- Generation for Photoshop | Fear ---
Token count: 1321

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to create a headline for Photoshop that addresses the fear of missing out or adds urgency. The persona's tone is fear, so the quote needs to tap into that emotion.

First, Step 1: Find three quotes that fit. They should relate to fear of missing out (FOMO) or urgency. Let's think of classic lines. "The early bird catches the worm" is about acting quickly. "Strike while the iron is hot" also emphasizes urgency. "Never look back" has a sense of moving forward without hesitation, which could relate to not missing opportunities. 

Why these? "The early bird..." directly connects to urgency and taking action before others. "Strike while the iron..." is similar but maybe a bit more common. "Never look back" might be less direct but could imply moving forward without regret. The best match is probably "The early bird..." because it's clear and ties into action to avoid missing out.

Step 2: Structure breakdown. Take the best quote: "The early bird catches the worm." Split into parts. The fixed part could be "catches the worm" since that's the metaphor. The editable parts are "early bird". We can replace "early" with something related to Photoshop and urgency. Maybe "The smart designer..." or "The pro user..." to include the brand. 

Step 3: Replacements. Replace "early bird" with "pro user" (since Photoshop is for professionals) and "bird" to something else? Wait, maybe "Photoshop user catches the best designs" or "The creative catches the vision." Wait, need to keep structure. Original quote is 7 words. Let me see: "The early bird catches the worm." Replacing "early bird" with "pro user" would make "The pro user catches the vision." Hmm, but vision might not fit. Maybe "The pro user captures the moment." But "captures" is a verb Photoshop uses. Alternatively, "The smart design catches the vision." Not sure. Alternatively, "The creative bird edits the future." No, maybe better to keep "catches" but change the first part. Let's think again. The goal is to include Photoshop and address FOMO. Maybe "The Photoshop pro never misses the shot." Wait, but the structure needs to preserve syntax. Maybe "The creative user edits the best." Not perfect. Alternatively, "The photo pro never misses the moment." That's changing two words. Let me check replacement rules: can only change up to two words, including brand name. Adding Photoshop counts. So the original is "The early bird catches the worm." If I replace "early bird" with "Photoshop pro" that's two words. Then the headline becomes "The Photoshop pro catches the vision." But "vision" is a keyword Photoshop uses. Or "The Photoshop pro captures the moment." "Captures" is good for photography/design. Alternatively, "The pro designer edits the future." Hmm. Maybe "The Photoshop pro never misses the shot." That uses "never misses" as urgency, but structure changes. Wait, need to keep the original structure. The original is "The [subject] catches the [object]." So replacing "early bird" with "Photoshop pro" and "worm" with something related. Maybe "vision" or "opportunity." So "The Photoshop pro catches the vision." That's concise and fits. Alternatively, "The Photoshop pro captures the moment." 

Step 4: Final headline using the best replacement. So "The Photoshop pro catches the vision." But does that make sense? Maybe "opportunity" instead of vision? "Catches the opportunity." Hmm. Alternatively, "The Photoshop pro never misses a detail." Wait, but structure must stay the same. The original structure is subject + catches the + noun. Maybe "The Photoshop pro captures the shot." Because "captures" is a term used in editing. That's better. So replacing "early bird" with "Photoshop pro" and "worm" with "shot." But the user said to change at most two words, including brand. The brand is Photoshop, so adding that is part of the two changes. So "early bird" becomes "Photoshop pro" (two words replaced?), but "bird" is part of "early bird." Wait, "early bird" is two words, so replacing "early" with "Photoshop pro" would be more than two words. Hmm, need to count correctly. Let me see:

Original: "The early bird catches the worm."

If I want to add "Photoshop" as part of the brand, perhaps "The Photoshop user catches the vision." Here, replacing "early bird" with "Photoshop user" (two words replaced: "early" and "bird" with "Photoshop user"), but that's two words. So that's allowed. Alternatively, "The Photoshop pro catches the shot." That works. The verb "catches" stays, the object could be "shot," which is a common term in photography. So the final headline would be "The Photoshop pro catches the shot." That fits the structure and brand, and addresses urgency.
</think>

Step 1:  
1. "The early bird catches the worm." — John Ray ★  
Why: Urgency to act quickly aligns with neutralizing fear of missing opportunities.  
2. "Strike while the iron is hot." — George Herbert  
Why: Encourages immediate action, countering hesitation.  
3. "Never look back, never look back." — Led Zeppelin (from "Whole Lotta Love")  
Why: Emphasizes forward momentum to reduce fear of past regrets.  

Step 2:  
Structure: "The | early bird | catches the | worm." |  
Editable parts: "early bird" (actor) and "worm" (reward/opportunity). "Catches the" is fixed to preserve rhythm.  

Step 3:  
Replacements:  
- **"Photoshop pro"** + **"opportunity"**: Replaces "early bird" and "worm" to highlight expertise and valuable outcomes (Photoshop as the key to success).  
- **"creative"** + **"vision"**: Focuses on artistic growth and clarity, tying into Photoshop’s creative purpose.

--- Generation for Photoshop | Fear ---
Token count: 2431

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to act as an award-winning headline copywriter. The task is to remix a classic quote into a brand headline for Photoshop, targeting the persona with the tone of "Fear," specifically neutralizing fear of missing out or adding urgency.

Starting with Step 1: Quote Matching. I need three classic quotes that fit the mood. Since the persona is fear, especially FOMO or urgency, the quotes should relate to missing out, urgency, or anxiety. 

First quote that comes to mind is "The early bird catches the worm." But maybe that's more about being proactive. Alternatively, "The last straw broke the camel's back" – but that's more about cumulative stress. Hmm. Maybe "Time waits for no one" by Socrates. That's about urgency and time slipping away, which fits FOMO. 

Another classic could be "He who hesitates is lost." That's about indecision leading to missing opportunities, perfect for urgency. 

The third might be "The grass is always greener on the other side." But that's more about envy. Wait, maybe "Don't look back, you're not going that way." Not sure. Alternatively, "Strike while the iron is hot." That's about acting quickly, which fits urgency. 

So let's pick three:

1. "The last leaf always falls first." – Unknown. Wait, maybe not. Maybe a song lyric? "The first cut is the deepest" – no. Maybe a Shakespeare quote? "Better three hours too soon than a minute too late." Hmm. Alternatively, "To be or not to be" – not. 

Alternatively, "The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page." Not exactly. Maybe "Haste makes waste" – opposite. 

Wait, the user's persona goal is to neutralize fear of missing out or add urgency. So the quotes should relate to that. 

First option: "The early bird catches the worm." (John Ray). This is about acting quickly. 

Second: "The last leaf falls, the first snow comes." (unknown). Not sure. 

Alternatively, "He who hesitates is lost." (Proverb). Perfect for urgency. 

Third: "Time and tide wait for no man." (Geoffrey Chaucer). Classic quote about time moving on. 

So compiling the three:

1. "Time waits for no one." – Socrates. Matches urgency and fear of missing out because time slipping away causes anxiety.

2. "He who hesitates is lost." – Proverb. Matches as indecision leads to missing opportunities, so acting now is crucial.

3. "The early bird catches the worm." – John Ray. Encourages quick action, which combats FOMO.

Now, mark the best. Which is better for Photoshop? The goal is to make people use Photoshop now, not wait. Maybe "He who hesitates is lost" is better because it directly ties hesitation to loss, which could be losing out on editing opportunities. But "Time waits for no one" is also strong, suggesting you can't delay editing, or your project might be too late. "Early bird" is more about being first, but maybe not as urgent. 

Probably the best is "Time waits for no one" ★. But need to check the exact wording. Alternatively, "The world will never stand still." But not as well-known. 

Wait, the user wants each sentence to be 5-10 words. "Time waits for no one" is 5 words. "He who hesitates is lost" is 6 words. "The early bird catches the worm" is 7 words. All good.

Step 1 explanations:

1. "Time waits for no one" – Socrates. Matches as it underscores urgency, aligning with neutralizing FOMO by emphasizing time's irreversibility. ★

2. "He who hesitates is lost" – Proverb. Matches by highlighting the consequences of delay, prompting immediate action to avoid missing out.

3. "The early bird catches the worm" – John Ray. Matches by encouraging proactive action to seize opportunities, reducing FOMO through initiative.

Now Step 2: Structure Breakdown. Take the best quote (★), which is "Time waits for no one" | but need to separate editable and fixed parts with |. Wait, the structure breakdown requires splitting the quote into parts that can be edited and those that stay fixed. 

Original quote: "Time waits for no one." 

To make it fit with Photoshop, maybe replace "Time" with the brand, or "no one" with something else. The editable parts could be "Time" and "no one". So structure would be: [Time] waits for no [one]. So the | separators would be | waits for no |. 

So the structure: "Time | waits for no | one". 

The fixed parts are "waits for no", and the editable parts are "Time" and "one". The brand (Photoshop) can replace "Time" to make it about the brand's urgency, or replace "one" with a keyword related to the brand's benefits.

Step 3: Vocabulary Replacement. Need 1-2 sets. 

First idea: Replace "Time" with "Photoshop" and "no one" with "perfectionist" (if that makes sense). But "Photoshop waits for no perfectionist"? Doesn't quite fit. Maybe "Photoshop waits for no delay"? Not quite. 

Alternatively, replace "Time" with "Opportunities" but that's not the brand. Hmm. The goal is to include the brand name. Let me think differently. 

Maybe keep "Time" but change "no one" to something like "your creativity". So "Time waits for no creativity". But that doesn't fit. 

Alternatively, make it "Photoshop waits for no delay" to encourage immediate use. Or "Photoshop waits for no project" – meaning you shouldn't wait to use it. 

Alternatively, replace "Time" with "Your best work" and "no one" with "Photoshop". "Your best work waits for no Photoshop" – no, that's backward. 

Wait, the brand needs to be included. Let's try to insert Photoshop as the subject. 

Original: "Time waits for no one."

If we make it "Photoshop waits for no one" – then the headline would be about Photoshop not waiting, so you have to act now. Maybe. But the message would be that you can't delay using Photoshop, because it's there waiting? Not sure. 

Alternatively, to make the urgency about the user acting, perhaps "Don't let opportunities wait for you" but that's a different structure. 

Wait, the structure must keep the syntax and meter. Original is 5 words. The remix should keep that. 

Perhaps replacing "no one" with "your creativity" to make it "Time waits for no creativity" – meaning you can't let creativity lag, so use Photoshop now. 

Alternatively, "Your ideas wait for no delay" – but that's changing two words. 

Hmm, perhaps better to use the structure where "Time" is replaced with a verb? Not sure. 

Alternatively, let's try replacing "no one" with "your next project". "Time waits for no project" – meaning you can't let time pass without starting your project, so use Photoshop now. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop waits for no delay" – replacing "Time" with "Photoshop" and "one" with "delay". So changing two words. 

Wait, the brand name is Photoshop, so inserting it into the quote. Let's see:

"Photoshop waits for no delay" – that's changing two words (Time → Photoshop, one → delay). The original quote is 5 words, so this would be the same structure. 

Another option: "Your vision waits for no delay" – but doesn't include the brand. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop waits for no hesitation" – replacing "Time" with Photoshop and "one" with hesitation. 

"Photoshop waits for no hesitation." That could work. The brand is mentioned, urgency to act (no hesitation). 

Another possibility: "Photoshop waits for no tomorrow" – implying you shouldn't wait, do it today. 

Comparing the two replacements:

1. "Photoshop waits for no delay." (Replaced Time → Photoshop, one → delay)

2. "Photoshop waits for no hesitation." (Same replacements with hesitation)

Both fit. Which is better? "Delay" might be more about acting now, while "hesitation" ties to the original quote's idea of indecision leading to missing opportunities. 

Step 4: Remix Headline. Let's choose "Photoshop waits for no hesitation." 

Wait, but the original quote's point is that time doesn't wait. By substituting "Photoshop" as the subject, the message is that Photoshop isn't waiting for your hesitation. So you need to use it now before it's too late. That makes sense. 

Alternatively, "Your best work waits for no Photoshop" – but that's inverse. 

Wait, the structure breakdown step says to separate the quote into editable parts. The original was "Time | waits for no | one". The first and third words can be edited. 

So to include the brand, perhaps replacing "Time" with "Opportunities" and "one" with "Photoshop users who wait". But that's too long. 

Alternatively, "Your creativity waits for no Photoshop" – no. 

Hmm, perhaps the best approach is to keep "waits for no" and replace the first and third words. 

Another idea: "Photoshop waits for no mistake" – but that's not about urgency. 

Wait, the user's persona goal is to neutralize fear of missing out or add urgency. So the headline should push the user to act now to avoid missing out. 

"Photoshop waits for no hesitation" – meaning that if you hesitate, you'll miss the chance to edit, etc. 

Alternatively, "Photoshop waits for no delay" – you can't delay using it; time is ticking. 

I think "Photoshop waits for no delay" is clearer. Delay is about not acting, so you must act now. 

Thus, the final headline would be "Photoshop waits for no delay."
</think>

Step 1:  
1. **Time waits for no one.** ★ — Socrates. Matches urgency and inevitability, aligning with FOMO’s fleeting opportunities.  
2. **He who hesitates is lost.** — Proverb. Matches indecision’s consequences, urging immediate action to avoid missing out.  
3. **The early bird catches the worm.** — John Ray. Matches proactive behavior to seize opportunities before they vanish.  

Step 2:  
Structure: **Time** | waits for no | **one**  
Editable parts: *Time* and *one* can be swapped with brand keywords. *Time* represents the catalyst for urgency; *one* can become a keyword highlighting Photoshop’s role in avoiding missed opportunities.  

Step 3:  
Replacements:  
1. **Photoshop | waits for no | delay** — Replaces “Time” (urgency) and “one” (opposite of delay) to tie the brand to acting immediately.  
2. **Creativity | waits for no | hesitation** — “Creativity” reflects Photoshop’s purpose, while “hesitation” mirrors the fear of missing inspiration.  

Step 4:

--- Generation for Photoshop | Fear ---
Token count: 1161

Okay, so I need to come up with three classic quotes that fit the persona of Fear and the brand Photoshop, with the goal of neutralizing fear of missing out or adding urgency. Let's start by thinking about quotes related to fear, missing out, or urgency. 

First quote that comes to mind is "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself" by Franklin D. Roosevelt. That's a classic about overcoming fear, which could tie into Photoshop helping users not fear missing out on creative opportunities. But wait, the persona is Fear itself, so maybe something that addresses the fear more directly.

Another option is "What's past is prologue" from Shakespeare. Hmm, maybe not directly related to fear or urgency. Maybe "The early bird catches the worm" which is about urgency, but that's more about being proactive. 

Wait, maybe "The fear of missing out is real" as a slang or meme phrase? That's more modern and directly about FOMO. The author might be unknown, but it's a common term. 

Another thought: "Carpe diem" from Horace, meaning seize the day. That's about urgency and not missing opportunities. But the original quote needs to be in English words. "Seize the day, make your today." Not exact. 

Wait, the user said the quote can be a lyric or meme. Maybe "This is why you're single" meme, but that's more about missing out on relationships. Not sure. 

Alternatively, "Better late than never" but that's the opposite of urgency. 

Another classic line: "Nothing to fear but fear itself" again FDR. Maybe that's better. But how to connect to Photoshop?

Third quote: "Time waits for no one" from Sappho. That's about urgency and missing out on time. 

So compiling three:

1. "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." - FDR. Matches because it addresses fear, suggesting Photoshop can help users overcome their fear of not being creative enough. 

2. "Time waits for no one." - Sappho. Matches urgency, implying that using Photoshop now prevents missing creative opportunities. 

3. "The early bird catches the worm." - Unknown. Encourages urgency to act quickly, tying into not missing out on Photoshop's benefits. 

Now, which is the best? The first one is directly about fear, which aligns with the persona. The second is urgency but less fear-focused. The third is also urgency. So maybe the FDR quote is best. Let me mark that as ★.

Structure breakdown: The original quote is "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." | The only thing we have to fear | is fear itself. 

Editable parts: "fear" and maybe "fear itself" but need to replace with brand terms. The goal is to neutralize fear of missing out or add urgency. So perhaps replace "fear" with something related to Photoshop. 

Possible replacements: Maybe "The only thing you need to edit is your fear" but that changes structure. Alternatively, replacing "fear" with "Photoshop" but that might not fit. Wait, the goal is to make it about not fearing missing out. Maybe "The only thing to fear is missing out on Photoshop" but that's changing two words. Let me see. 

Wait, the original structure is "The only thing [we have] to fear is fear itself." To fit the brand, maybe change the second "fear" to "Photoshop" or "your creativity." For example: "The only thing to fear is not using Photoshop." That keeps the structure, changes "fear itself" to "not using Photoshop", which adds urgency. That works. So replacing "fear itself" with "not using Photoshop" or similar. 

Another possibility: "The only thing you need to fear is missing out on Photoshop." Here, replacing "fear itself" with "missing out on Photoshop", which directly ties to FOMO. 

So in structure breakdown, the editable parts would be the two instances of "fear" or the latter part. The replacements would be in the second part. 

So step 3: Replacements could be "missing out on Photoshop" instead of "fear itself" because it addresses FOMO. Alternatively, "not using Photoshop" to encourage urgency. 

Final headline would be: "The only thing to fear is missing out on Photoshop." That keeps the structure, uses the brand name, and adds urgency by highlighting FOMO.
</think>

Explanation:  
1. ★ "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." — Franklin D. Roosevelt  
   Matches as it directly addresses fear, positioning Photoshop as the solution to overcome hesitation.  
2. "Time waits for no one." — Sappho  
   Suggests urgency to act before opportunities pass, aligning with neutralizing FOMO.  
3. "The early bird catches the worm." — Unknown  
   Encourages proactive action to avoid missing out on advantages.  

Structure:  
The only thing we have to fear | is fear itself.  
Editable parts: "fear" (first instance) and "fear itself" (second instance). Replace to align with brand and urgency.  

Replacements:  
1. "missing out on Photoshop" → replaces "fear itself" to emphasize FOMO resolution.  
2. "not using Photoshop" → replaces "fear itself" to imply urgency through missed potential.  

Remix Headline:  
"The only thing to fear is missing out on Photoshop."

--- Generation for Coca-Cola | Pride ---
Token count: 1166

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to come up with a headline for Coca-Cola using a remix of a classic quote that fits the pride and achievement/exclusivity theme. 

Starting with Step 1: Quote Matching. I need three quotes that align with the persona's tone of pride and the brand's goal to celebrate achievement or exclusivity. The quotes should be concise (5-10 words), and I need to explain why each fits and pick the best one.

First, I'll think of famous quotes related to pride, success, or exclusivity. Maybe "Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is." by Vince Lombardi? That's about the desire to succeed, which fits achievement. 

Another option: "The only impossible journey is the one you never begin." from author unknown. It's about taking the first step, which can be linked to embarking on a journey to success. 

Third quote: "There are no spectators in life." by author unknown. This emphasizes active participation, which can tie into being part of an exclusive group. 

Now, evaluating which is best. The first one directly relates to winning, which is about achievement. The second is more about starting, but maybe less directly connected. The third might be too vague. The Vince Lombardi quote seems like the best fit for celebrating the drive to achieve. 

For Step 2: Structure Breakdown. Take the best quote (★) and break it into parts. The quote is "Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is." I need to separate the fixed and editable parts. The key words to replace could be "Winning" and "winning" with something related to Coca-Cola, like "The Coca-Cola moment" or "the bottle" but keeping it concise. 

Step 3: Replacements. Maybe replace "Winning" with "Achieving" and "win" with "savor the moment" but that might be too long. Alternatively, "Coca-Cola isn't everything, but wanting to celebrate is." That keeps the structure and adds the brand name. 

Wait, the user said to replace at most two words, including the brand name. Let me think again. Original quote: "Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is." To add Coca-Cola, maybe substitute "Winning" with "Celebrating" and the last "win" with "Coca-Cola" so it becomes "Celebrating isn’t everything, but wanting to Coca-Cola is." Hmm, that doesn't flow. Maybe "The Coca-Cola moment isn’t everything, but wanting it is." That might work better. 

Alternatively, "Excellence isn’t everything, but wanting Coca-Cola is." Not sure. Maybe the best is "Achievement isn’t everything, but wanting to celebrate is with Coca-Cola." But need to keep structure. 

Step 4: Remix Headline. Maybe "Achieving isn’t everything, but wanting to celebrate is with Coca-Cola." That keeps the original structure and replaces "Winning" and "win" with "Achieving" and "celebrate", adding the brand at the end. 

Wait, the original quote's structure is two clauses with parallel structure. Let me check again. Original: "Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is." So the structure is [Noun] + verb + ... but wanting to [verb] + is. 

To replace, maybe "Celebrating isn’t everything, but wanting to Coca-Cola is." No, that doesn't make sense. Maybe "The moment isn’t everything, but wanting to savor it with Coca-Cola is." 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola isn’t everything, but wanting to celebrate is." That's shorter. It changes "Winning" to "Coca-Cola" and "win" to "celebrate". Replaced two words: first noun and last verb. 

Yes, that could work. "Coca-Cola isn’t everything, but wanting to celebrate is." That fits the structure, mentions the brand, and aligns with celebrating achievement. 

I think that's the best approach. Let me put it all into the required steps now.
</think>

Step 1【Quote Matching】  
1. "Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is." ★ (Vince Lombardi)  
Why: Celebrates ambition and the drive to succeed, aligning with Coca-Cola’s role in fueling moments of triumph.  
2. "The only impossible journey is the one you never begin." (Author unknown)  
Why: Encourages action, implying Coca-Cola accompanies pivotal life journeys.  
3. "There are no spectators in life." (Author unknown)  
Why: Suggests Coca-Cola is for active, exclusive participants in meaningful moments.  

Step 2【Structure Breakdown】  
★ Quote: "Winning isn’t everything |, but wanting to win | is."  
Editable: "Winning" and "win" (replace to insert brand/achievement keywords). Fixed: "isn’t everything" and "but wanting to... is."  

Step 3【Vocabulary Replacement】  
1. "Celebrating | isn’t everything |, but wanting to | Coca-Cola | is."  
Why: Replaces "win" with "Coca-Cola," tying the brand to joy.  
2. "Achieving | isn’t everything |, but wanting to | share success with Coke | is."  
Why: Focuses on exclusivity and communal achievement.  

Step 4【Remix Generation】  
Remix Headline: "Celebrating isn’t everything, but wanting to Coca-Cola is."

Okay, so I need to come up with three classic quotes that fit the Coca-Cola brand with a tone of pride, celebrating achievement or exclusivity. Let me think of some quotes related to pride or success. 

First, maybe "The early bird catches the worm." But that's more about diligence than pride. Hmm. "Pride comes before the fall" – but that's negative. Wait, the persona wants to celebrate achievement, so maybe something positive like "The best things in life are free," but Coca-Cola isn't free. 

How about "Live life to the fullest"? That's a Coca-Cola kind of sentiment. Wait, maybe that's their tagline already? Not sure. Let me think of popular quotes. 

Oh, "Just Do It" is Nike. Not a quote. "I am the king of the world!" from Titanic – that's about pride and achievement. But maybe too specific. 

There's "You can't always get what you want, but if you try sometimes you might find you get what you need" by Rolling Stones. Not exactly pride. 

Hmm, "The sky's the limit" by Kanye? Maybe. That's about potential and success. "We are the champions" by Queen. That's perfect for celebration. 

Also, "We didn't start the fire" but not relevant. 

Another one could be "It's not about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving" from Rocky. But that's perseverance. 

Wait, "To infinity and beyond!" from Toy Story – adventurous, but maybe not directly pride. 

"Keep calm and carry on" is more resilient. 

Let me list three candidates. 

1. "We are the champions" by Queen – celebrates achievement, pride in victory. 
2. "The best is yet to come" by Frank Sinatra – looks forward to more success. 
3. "The only way is up" by unknown – suggests upward progress, exclusivity. 

Wait, maybe "It's better to burn out than fade away" by Neil Young, but that's more intense. 

Alternatively, "Pride goes before a fall" but negative. 

I think "We are the champions" is best because it directly relates to being champions, which is about achievement. "The best is yet to come" is good for looking forward but maybe not as strong for pride. 

Third one could be "You're never fully dressed without a smile" which is more about positivity, not exactly pride. 

Hmm, maybe "The proof is in the pudding" – but not relevant. 

Alternatively, "Success is not final, failure is not fatal" by Churchill, but too long. 

Wait, maybe "To be the greatest" from Muhammad Ali. "The greatest" is about pride in being the best. 

Alternatively, "I am what I am" by Madonna, but more about authenticity. 

Okay, going with the three I have: 

1. "We are the champions" by Queen – ★ best match because it's about celebration and achievement. 

2. "The sky's the limit" – maybe not a quote but a saying. 

Wait, maybe "Diamonds are a girl's best friend" but not relevant. 

Alternatively, "Just do it" is a tagline but maybe considered a popular expression. 

Hmm, need to ensure each quote is 5-10 words. Let me check the original examples. 

Original user example had quotes like "I'll be back" so maybe short phrases. 

So "We are the champions" is 5 words, by Queen. 

Second could be "The best is yet to come" (6 words, Frank Sinatra). 

Third: "Victory or death" – too short. 

Maybe "The journey is worth the destination" – no. 

Alternatively, "Winning isn't everything, but wanting to win is" by Vince Lombardi, but too long. 

Hmm. Maybe "Pride and glory" – not a quote. 

Alright, I'll go with three: 

1. "We are the champions" by Queen – ★ 
2. "The best is yet to come" by Frank Sinatra 
3. "The only way is up" – anonymous 

Now, for each explanation: 

First quote explains why it's best because it's a strong celebration of achievement. 

Second because it suggests future success. 

Third because it implies upward progress. 

Now structure breakdown. The best is "We are the champions". 

Structure: "We are the champions | " 

Wait, need to break it into editable parts. Maybe "We are the [adjective] | " 

Wait the quote is "We are the champions of the world" but the user's example had splitting with |. Let me see the original step 2 example. 

Original example: "We accept the things we cannot change | and change the things we cannot accept." Split into | between editable parts. 

In "We are the champions", maybe the "champions" can be replaced. So structure: "We are the | champions | . " 

Wait the full quote from Queen is "We are the champions, my friends...", but the short version is "We are the champions". So split as "We are the | champions | . " where champions is the editable part. 

The fixed part would be "We are the" and the period. 

So structure breakdown would be "We are the | champions | ." 

Replaceable word: champions. Why? Because Coca-Cola wants to position itself as the champion in the beverage industry, so replacing "champions" with a keyword like "heroes", "celebration", etc. 

Wait, but the brand is Coca-Cola. The replacements should be brand keywords. Maybe "champions" can be replaced with "Coca-Cola" or "best" or something else. 

Wait the brand name can be added. The user says "include brand name / keyword". So maybe in the remix, instead of "champions" use "Coca-Cola's celebration" or "champions of thirst"? Not sure. 

Alternatively, structure breakdown: "We are the | champions | ." 

Replaceable words: "champions" can be changed to a brand-related term. 

Alternatively, maybe "We are the" and the rest can be adjusted. 

Then in vocabulary replacement, possible sets: 

1. "heroes" – to imply they're the hero drink. 

2. "celebration" – since Coca-Cola is linked to celebration. 

So first set: "We are the celebration." 

Second set: "We are the Coca-Cola champions." But that might be too long. 

Wait, need to keep original structure as much as possible, changing at most two words. Since original quote is 5 words, the replacements should keep it concise. 

So in the remix, using the best replacement. 

Hmm, maybe "We are the Coca-Cola" but that's too abrupt. 

Alternatively, "We are the champion drink." 

Wait, but "champions" plural vs. "champion drink" singular. 

Alternatively, "We are the champions, Coca-Cola" but not sure. 

Alternatively, "We are the celebration" where "champions" is replaced with "celebration". 

The final remix would need to include the brand name. 

So perhaps replacing "champions" with "Coca-Cola's champions" but that might exceed two words change. 

Wait the limit is changing at most two words. Original quote is 5 words: "We are the champions". 

If I replace "champions" with "Coca-Cola's best" that would be two words, but that might not make sense. 

Alternatively, "We are the Coca-Cola champions". That adds "Coca-Cola" before champions, making it two words added. But that's three words instead of one. Wait, the original word is one (champions), so replacing it with two words would count as two changes? 

Hmm, the user says "changing at most two words from the original quote". So "champions" can be replaced with a phrase like "Coca-Cola's champions" (adding "Coca-Cola's" which is two words), so total changes from original: replacing "champions" with "Coca-Cola's champions" would mean adding two words. But maybe better to just add the brand in a way that keeps it concise. 

Alternatively, "We are the champions of Coca-Cola". 

But the original quote is short, so maybe better to have "We are the Coca-Cola champions". 

Then the remix headline would be "We are the Coca-Cola champions." 

Alternatively, to make it more about celebration: "We are the celebration" with the tagline mentioning Coca-Cola. 

Alternatively, "We are the Coca-Cola" but that's too short. 

Alternatively, use "We are the champions of thirst" (play on "champion drink"). 

Hmm, perhaps better to go with "We are the Coca-Cola champions." 

That keeps the original structure, replaces "champions" with "Coca-Cola's champions" but actually adding "Coca-Cola" as the possessive? Wait, "Coca-Cola champions" might be better. 

Wait, in the remix generation step, the instruction says to include the brand name/keyword. So the final headline must have the brand name. 

So the best option would be to replace "champions" with "Coca-Cola" but that would make "We are the Coca-Cola." Which is shorter, but maybe not. 

Alternatively, structure: "We are the champions of Coca-Cola" which adds "of Coca-Cola" making it longer. 

Alternatively, changing "champions" to "Coca-Cola celebration" so "We are the Coca-Cola celebration." 

Hmm, maybe that's better. 

Alternatively, "We are the champions of celebration." But then the brand is not mentioned. 

Wait, maybe the structure allows inserting the brand name. Let me think again. 

Original quote: "We are the champions." 

Structure breakdown: "We are the | champions | ." 

So the editable part is "champions". 

Replacement options: 

Set 1: "Coca-Cola" → "We are the Coca-Cola." 

But that might be too short and maybe not convey the achievement. 

Set 2: "champions of celebration" → but that's two words. 

Alternatively, "champions of Coca-Cola" → so "We are the champions of Coca-Cola." 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's champions" → "We are the Coca-Cola's champions." 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, replacing "champions" with "celebration" → "We are the celebration." Then the brand name is added as part of the headline. But the instruction says the headline should include the brand name/keyword. 

Wait, the user's example shows that the final headline includes the brand name. For instance, "Just Do It: Nike" or similar. 

So maybe the best approach is to replace "champions" with "Coca-Cola champions" but that's two words. Wait, the original word was "champions", so replacing it with "Coca-Cola" (one word) would change it to "We are the Coca-Cola." That's concise but maybe lacks the achievement aspect. 

Alternatively, use "celebration champions" → but that's two words. 

Alternatively, maybe the structure allows inserting the brand in the fixed part. 

Wait the user says in structure breakdown to separate editable parts with |. The fixed parts can't be changed. 

So if the structure is "We are the | champions | ." then only the "champions" part can be changed. 

So to include the brand name, it has to be part of that editable section. 

Thus, "Coca-Cola" would replace "champions", making it "We are the Coca-Cola." 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola's champions" (adding 's) which is two words. 

Wait the user allows adding the brand name as part of the word changes. The limit is changing at most two words. Since "champions" is one word, replacing it with two words is allowed. 

Thus, "Coca-Cola's champions" would be two words replacing one, but that's okay. 

So the remix would be "We are the Coca-Cola's champions." 

Hmm, but maybe better phrased as "We are the Coca-Cola champions" (without apostrophe). 

Alternatively, "We are the Coca-Cola celebration." 

Wait, "celebration" is a key association with Coca-Cola. 

Alternatively, "We are the Coca-Cola champions of taste." 

But that adds more words. 

Hmm, perhaps "We are the Coca-Cola champions." is the best. It keeps the structure, adds the brand name, and conveys pride and achievement. 

Alternatively, "We are the celebration" with the brand name mentioned, but maybe the user expects the quote to be rephrased with the brand in the mix. 

So I'll proceed with that. 

Now, putting it all together: 

Step 1:

1. "We are the champions" – Queen. ★ Because it directly celebrates achievement and collective pride.
2. "The best is yet to come" – Frank Sinatra. Suggests ongoing success and future triumph.
3. "Victory or death" – Anonymous war cry emphasizing exclusivity through extreme commitment.

Step 2:

Structure breakdown for ★ quote: "We are the | champions | ."

Step 3:

Replacements: 
1. "Coca-Cola" → "We are the Coca-Cola." (brand name insertion)
2. "celebration" → "We are the celebration." (brand keyword, ties to Coca-Cola's association with joy)

Step 4:

Final headline: "We are the Coca-Cola." But maybe that's too short. Alternatively, "We are the Coca-Cola champions."

Wait, maybe better to go with "We are the celebration." plus the brand name somehow. But how? 

Alternatively, "We are the Coca-Cola champions" which includes the brand and keeps the champion's pride. 

Yes, that works. So the final headline would be "We are the Coca-Cola champions."
</think>

Explanation:  
1. "We are the champions" – Queen. ★ Celebrates collective triumph and pride.  
2. "The best is yet to come" – Frank Sinatra. Suggests future achievements, aligning with exclusivity.  
3. "Victory or death" – Anonymous. Emphasizes boldness and exclusivity through intensity.  

Structure: "We are the | champions | ."  

Replacements:  
1. **Coca-Cola** → "We are the Coca-Cola." (Brand name insertion as the achievement itself)  
2. **celebration** → "We are the celebration." (Brand keyword linking to Coca-Cola's festive identity)  

Remix Headline: "We are the Coca-Cola."

--- Generation for Coca-Cola | Pride ---
Token count: 3167

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a headline for Coca-Cola that celebrates achievement or exclusivity with a pride tone. First, I need to find three classic quotes that fit. Pride and exclusivity make me think of quotes about being the best, standing out, or something iconic.

Starting with famous quotes. "I'm king of the world!" from The Titanic? That's about triumph and pride, but maybe too specific. "The pen is mightier than the sword" by Bulwer-Lytton? Not sure about the connection to achievement. Wait, "You're never fully dressed without a smile" is a popular saying, but maybe not fitting here.

Hmm, maybe "We don't need roads" from Mad Max? That's about freedom but not exactly pride. Wait, Coca-Cola's "Open Happiness" campaign comes to mind, but that's their slogan. Need something else. 

Oh, "Just do it" is Nike's, but maybe not a quote. Let me think of actual quotes. "Be all you can be" was an Army slogan. Not a quote. "The greatest glory in living is to know your place in the universe and be content." Einstein? Not quite. 

Wait, "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts." Churchill? Maybe not. 

Alternatively, "There is no substitute for victory." General Patton. That's about triumph, so maybe. 

Or "Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing." Red Smith. That's more about achievement. 

Wait, maybe "The early bird catches the worm," but that's about effort. Not sure. 

Another angle: exclusivity. "Diamonds are forever" from the movie? That's more about longevity and exclusivity. 

Wait, "I am the first and I am the last," from the Bible? Not sure. 

Wait, "The greatest victory is over oneself." Japanese proverb. 

Hmm. Maybe "The best things in life are free" by Haskel. But Coca-Cola isn't free. 

Alternatively, "Coke is it!" which is an old slogan. But need a non-brand quote. 

Wait, maybe "You can't always get what you want" by Rolling Stones, but the next line is "but if you try sometimes you might find you get what you need." Not exactly. 

Wait, "I think therefore I am" by Descartes? Not relevant. 

Wait, "The world is yours." That's a lyric from Hamilton, maybe? "The world is yours for the taking" – that's from a song or movie. 

Wait, "The world is yours to conquer." That's a common saying. 

Alternatively, "The sky's the limit." That's about achievement. 

Wait, maybe "Just do it" but that's Nike. 

Wait, "We are the champions" by Queen. "We are the champions, my friends." That's perfect for celebrating achievement and pride. The quote is short enough? "We are the champions" is 3 words, but need 5-10. Maybe the full line: "We are the champions, my friends" by Queen. 

Another one: "The greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time you fall." Confucius? 

Hmm. 

Wait, "It's not about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." Rocky. 

Alternatively, "Live every moment as if it's your last." Steve Jobs? 

Wait, maybe "The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams." Eleanor Roosevelt. 

Hmm. Need three. 

Alternatively, "The best revenge is massive success." Frank Sinatra. 

Wait, "Stay hungry, stay foolish." Steve Jobs. 

Hmm. 

Let me compile three quotes. 

First quote: "The world is yours to conquer." That's a motivational saying, maybe not attributed to anyone. Wait, maybe from a movie. 

Alternatively, "The impossible is just a big challenge." Not sure. 

Wait, "No one can do everything, but everyone can do something." Not sure. 

Wait, maybe "Winning isn't everything, but the effort makes the difference." Not exact. 

Alternatively, "Success is not the key to happiness. Happiness is the key to success." Albert Schweitzer. 

Hmm. 

Alternatively, "You are the wind beneath my wings." Bette Midler. Not exactly. 

Wait, "Keep your head up." Common saying. 

Alternatively, "You're never alone if you have yourself." Not sure. 

Wait, maybe "The greatest glory in living is not in never falling, but in rising every time you fall." That's from Confucius? Or Nelson Mandela? 

Mandela said that. So that's a good quote for perseverance leading to achievement. 

Second quote could be "The world is yours." From the movie "Crash" or something. 

Third quote: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." Steve Jobs. 

Wait, but the persona is pride, celebrating achievement/exclusivity. 

So first quote: "The world is yours to conquer." Author? Maybe attributed to various. Let's check. 

Alternatively, "The greatest glory is in never falling." But that's part of Mandela's quote. 

Wait, maybe three quotes: 

1. "The world is yours to conquer." - Unattributed, but used in media. It's about claiming ownership/achievement, fits pride and exclusivity. 

2. "The impossible is possible when you believe." – Maybe from a motivational poster, author unknown. 

3. "You can't win unless you play." – Anonymous. Not sure. 

Hmm, maybe better to find exact quotes. Let me think again. 

Wait, "I think we can all agree that there's a certain je ne sais quoi about Coca-Cola." No, that's not a classic quote. 

Alternatively, "It's the most magical of all sodas." Not a quote. 

Wait, "The best thing since sliced bread." Common saying. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola, the real thing." That's their slogan. 

Wait, maybe use "It's not just a drink, it's a legend." 

But need existing quotes. 

Another angle: luxury and exclusivity. 

"For those moments worth savoring." Not a quote. 

Wait, "Diamonds are forever." From the James Bond movie. That's about exclusivity and lasting value. 

That's a strong candidate. "Diamonds are forever" by Ian Fleming. 

So quote 1: "Diamonds are forever." by Ian Fleming. Because it's about exclusivity and lasting legacy, fitting the brand's premium image. 

Second quote: "The world is yours to conquer." Maybe by a motivational author. 

Third quote: "We are the champions." by Queen. 

Wait, let's check word counts:

"Diamonds are forever." – 4 words. 

"The world is yours to conquer." – 7 words. 

"We are the champions, my friends." – 6 words (the full lyric). 

These fit 5-10 words. 

Now, explain why each matches: 

1. Diamonds are forever: emphasizes lasting value and exclusivity, aligning with Coca-Cola's timeless appeal and premium positioning. 

2. The world is yours to conquer: conveys achievement and confidence, suitable for celebrating success. 

3. We are the champions: evokes triumph and pride in collective success. 

Which is best? Probably "Diamonds are forever" because of its association with luxury and permanence, matching Coca-Cola's brand status. 

So Step 1 done. 

Now Step 2: Structure Breakdown. 

Take the best quote: "Diamonds are forever." ★

Split into | parts. Fixed parts are "Diamonds are", and "forever." The editable part is "Diamonds" and "forever". Wait, but need to see structure. 

Alternatively, the structure could be "Diamonds | are forever." 

But to make it a headline, replacing "Diamonds" with Coca-Cola and keeping the rest. 

Wait, maybe "Coca-Cola is forever." But not as impactful. 

Alternatively, replace "Diamonds" with the brand, so: 

"Brand is forever." 

So the structure: [Brand] | are forever. 

But "are" needs to agree with the noun. If replacing "Diamonds" (plural) with a singular noun like "Coca-Cola", then "is" instead of "are". 

Hmm, tricky. 

Alternatively, the original quote is "Diamonds are forever", so if we replace "Diamonds" with a singular noun like "Coca-Cola", the sentence becomes "Coca-Cola is forever". 

Alternatively, maybe changing "are forever" to "last forever", but that's adding words. 

Alternatively, structure: [Brand] are forever. But brand is singular. 

Wait, perhaps the structure is [Brand] is forever. 

Alternatively, to keep the same structure: "Coca-Cola are forever" is incorrect grammar. So maybe need to adjust. 

Alternatively, changing "Diamonds" to "Cokes" but that's slang. 

Hmm. Maybe the quote can be slightly adjusted for grammar. 

So structure: "Coca-Cola is forever." That keeps the syntax, but changes "Diamonds are" to "Coca-Cola is". 

So the editable parts are "Diamonds" and "are" → "Coca-Cola" and "is". But the original quote is "Diamonds are forever", so splitting into | parts as:

Diamonds | are forever.

Thus, replacing "Diamonds" with "Coca-Cola" and "are" with "is". But that's two changes, which is allowed since the constraint says max two words changed, including brand name. 

The brand name counts as one change. So replacing "Diamonds" (first word) with "Coca-Cola", and "are" with "is", that's two changes. 

Alternatively, perhaps the fixed part is "are forever", and the first word is editable. 

Structure: [Coca-Cola] | are forever. But since "Coca-Cola" is singular, "are" should be "is". So the replacement would require changing both the noun and verb. 

Hmm. Maybe the original quote is better suited because "forever" is a strong word, so changing "Diamonds" to "Coca-Cola" and keeping "are" would require "Coca-Cola are", which is incorrect. 

Alternative approach: maybe use "Coca-Cola's moment is forever." But that adds words. 

Alternatively, rephrase as "Coca-Cola lasts forever." But changes two words. 

Alternatively, the best approach is to adjust the structure to keep correct grammar. So the fixed part is "is forever", replacing "Diamonds are" with "Coca-Cola is". 

So structure breakdown would be: 

Structure: [Coca-Cola] | is forever. 

But the original quote was "Diamonds are forever", so splitting as "Diamonds | are forever". Replacing "Diamonds" with "Coca-Cola" and "are" with "is" (two changes). 

Therefore, the structure is "Diamonds | are forever." 

Replacements: 

Replace "Diamonds" with "Coca-Cola" (brand name) and "are" with "is" (to match subject-verb agreement). 

Alternatively, another option is to keep "are" but use a plural noun, but the brand is singular. 

Hmm. 

Another possibility: "Coca-Cola, like diamonds, is forever." But that adds more words. 

Alternatively, just go with "Coca-Cola is forever." as the replacement, considering that the main point is to keep the essence. 

Now, for the replacements:

Option 1: "Coca-Cola is forever." (changed "Diamonds" to "Coca-Cola", "are" to "is") 

Option 2: Maybe "Coca-Cola's moments are forever." – changing "Diamonds" to "Coca-Cola's moments" (two words), but that's stretching. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: forever." But that's shorter. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola lasts forever." (changes "Diamonds are" to "Coca-Cola lasts"). 

Which is better? 

The first option "Coca-Cola is forever" keeps the structure of the original quote more. 

So the best replacement set is:

1. "Coca-Cola is forever." (replacing Diamonds with Coca-Cola, are with is)

Reason: preserves the eternal and exclusive nature of the original quote, aligning with Coca-Cola's iconic status. 

Another possible option could be using "Moments are forever" but with the brand name. 

Wait, maybe another quote could be better. Let's think again. 

The second quote was "The world is yours to conquer." 

Structure breakdown for that: "The world | is yours to conquer." 

Replace "The world" with "Coca-Cola" → "Coca-Cola is yours to conquer." 

Hmm, but that doesn't fit the brand well. 

Alternatively, replace "conquer" with "enjoy" → "Coca-Cola is yours to enjoy." But that's more about accessibility. 

Alternatively, "Coca-Cola: the world is yours to conquer." But the original quote is more about achievement, so maybe that's okay. 

But the first quote "Diamonds are forever" seems better for exclusivity and timelessness. 

Thus, proceeding with the first quote. 

Step 3 replacements done. 

Step 4: Remix Headline: "Coca-Cola is forever." 

But does that include the brand name and fit all constraints? 

Yes, it's neutral, mentions the brand, ends with period, and keeps the structure. 

Alternatively, could it be "Forever is Coca-Cola's promise." but that changes more. 

Alternatively, maybe add a verb: "Coca-Cola lasts forever." 

"Lasts" emphasizes durability, which might tie to product longevity, but the original quote's "are" is about existence. 

"Coca-Cola is forever." is concise and matches the structure. 

Thus, that's the final headline.
</think>
